    "Title": "Impact of FDA advisory on reported vacuum-assisted delivery and morbidity.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In May 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a health advisory reporting neonatal injuries/deaths following vacuum delivery and encouraged voluntary reports of future adverse events. We compared FDA reports of vacuum delivery adverse events prior to and following the advisory. METHODS: The FDA database (MAUDE) was searched for vacuum deliveries using brand name, manufacturer name, and procedure \"string searches.\" Cases were sorted by report date, source, and manufacturer. Neonatal morbidity was quantified as deaths and life-threatening or nonlife-threatening events. RESULTS: A total of 80 reported adverse cases were identified after duplicate cases were consolidated. Twenty-five were reported to the FDA prior to the 1998 advisory and 55 in the immediate 6-month period following the advisory. There was a 22-fold increase in reported events from five events/year prior to the advisory to an estimated 110 events/year following the advisory. The distribution of reporting sources changed significantly following the advisory with increased \"manufacturer\" (8-43%) and decreased \"voluntary\" reports (56-20%). All major brand names were represented. During the 6 months following the FDA advisory there were 10 neonatal deaths, 30 life-threatening events, 12 nonlife-threatening events, and three equipment-related reports. Infant deaths were due to intracranial or subgaleal hematomas. Injuries included skull fracture, scalp abrasions, and cephalohematomas. CONCLUSIONS: The FDA advisory was associated with a 22-fold increase in the rate of reported adverse events. This increase in reporting likely represents both enhanced awareness of complications as well as an increase in vacuum-related adverse neonatal sequelae. As vacuum delivery is associated with greater neonatal morbidity/ mortality than was previously recognized, the adage that the vacuum is \"designed to come off before infant damage occurs\" appears unsubstantiated. It is recommended that manufacturers quantify the suction and traction capabilities of present and new proposed vacuum cup designs.",

    "Title": "Unexpected ICD pulse generator failure due to electronic circuit damage caused by electrical overstress.",
    "Abstract": "Because it is a lifesaving device, the unexpected failure of an ICD can be catastrophic. We report ICD electronic circuit failure due to electrical overstress damage (EOS) to the high voltage hybird circuit and other electronic components in a series of ICD pulse generator models. Data were obtained from the Multicenter Registry of Pacemaker and ICD Pacemaker and Lead Failures, and from the manufactures' adverse event reports, that were in the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Of 16 nonbattery Guidant/CPI ICD pulse generator failures reported to the registry, 6 (38%) have been confirmed by the manufacturer to be EOS related, and Guidant/CPI has reported 273 such failures to the FDA as of 12/29/00. The signs of failure included loss of telemetry and inability to deliver therapy, and some patients have experienced serious adverse events. Hybrid circuit damage may have occurred during capacitor charging or reform, and the majority appears to have happened during normal ICD function. While the incidence of this problem is unknown, a management strategy should be adopted that includes routine follow-up every 3 months and device evaluation after a shock or exposure to external defibrillation or electrosurgical devices. This study suggests that additional data are needed to determine the incidence of this problem, and that our present methods for monitoring the performance of ICD's following market release are inadequate.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with optical-access laparoscopic trocars.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number and type of serious complications associated with optical-access trocars reported by sources other than the medical literature. METHODS: Optical-access trocars, first introduced in 1994, were designed to decrease the risk of injury to intra-abdominal structures by allowing the surgeon to visualize abdominal wall layers during placement. To date, very few complications with their use have been reported in the medical literature. MEDLINE, the Food and Drug Administration's Medical Device Reporting, and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience databases were searched for reports of complications occurring during the use of optical-access trocars for laparoscopic access. RESULTS: Only two serious complications resulting from the use of optical-access trocars (vena cava injuries) have been reported in the medical literature. However, 79 serious complications using these techniques have been cited in the Medical Device Reporting and Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience databases since 1994. These include 37 major vascular injuries involving aorta, vena cava, or iliac vessels, 18 bowel perforations, 20 cases of significant bleeding from other sites, three liver lacerations, and one stomach perforation. Four of these complications resulted in patient deaths. CONCLUSION: Optical-access trocars may be associated with significant injuries despite having the ability to visualize tissue layers during insertion.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronans (HAs) are indicated for pain relief of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Hyalgan (sodium hyaluronate), Supartz (sodium hyaluronate), and Synvisc (hylan G-F 20) are Food and Drug Administration-approved HA products. They are derived from rooster combs; Hyalgan and Supartz are naturally derived (unmodified); Synvisc is chemically modified to increase its molecular weight. This article reviews and updates the safety data for IA HAs used for the treatment of knee OA. METHODS: References were taken from Medline through July 2002; respective product information services and information from the searchable United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database also were used. RESULTS: All products demonstrated favorable safety profiles in clinical trials and practice compared to other standard therapies for management of OA knee pain. The most common adverse event associated with HAs is mild injection site pain and swelling. Each product has had rare reports of pseudogout and anaphylactoid reactions. Product-specific adverse events, severe acute inflammatory reactions (pseudoseptic knee), in patients receiving Synvisc have been reported. One such patient developed antibodies to chicken proteins and hylan, suggesting an immunologic basis for the severe acute inflammatory reaction. Data from an animal study support a possible immunogenic difference between Synvisc and Hyalgan. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, HA therapy is a safe treatment for OA knee pain, although there may be interproduct variability in safety profiles.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with global endometrial ablation: the utility of the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number and type of complications associated with global endometrial ablation using public-access governmental databanks. METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed) and the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) databases were searched for entries for the four US Food and Drug Administration-approved global endometrial ablation devices. RESULTS: Traditional MEDLINE and bibliography searches yielded reports of two cases of hemorrhage, one case of pelvic inflammatory disease, 20 cases of endometritis, two cases of first-degree skin burns, nine cases of hematometra, and 16 cases of vaginitis and/or cystitis. A search of the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database yielded reports of 85 complications in 62 patients. These included major complications: eight cases of thermal bowel injury, 30 cases of uterine perforation, 12 cases in which emergent laparotomy was required, and three intensive care unit admissions. One patient developed necrotizing fasciitis and eventually underwent vulvectomy, ureterocutaneous ostomy, and bilateral below-the-knee amputations. One of the patients with thermal injury to the bowel died. CONCLUSION: Use of the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database is helpful in identifying serious complications associated with global endometrial ablation not yet reported in the medical literature.",

    "Title": "Endovascular stents: market vigilance and risk factors.",
    "Abstract": "With the aim of enhancing the safety and reliability level of coronary stents, we analyzed data collected from accident reports drawn from the MAUDE database (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database) of the FDA from 1996 to 2000. This analysis allowed us to highlight problems related to the use of coronary stents by means of the analysis of these reports at different levels, beginning from the causes that can lead to a certain type of accident up to the possible complication related to that event. Moreover we analyzed the procedure outcomes in terms of stent position inside the patient's body and the possible therapies adopted to solve the problems. The results showed that the most probable event that can lead to an accident is the stent separation from the balloon which, alone, turns up in a number of cases equal to the sum of all the others. This result highlights the importance of the technical skill of the operators accomplished by special training and of the importance of clarity and completeness in the instructions for the use of the device. Another critical point is the reliability of the device which must guarantee an adequate safety level when it is used according to the instructions.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of stapling devices has become standard practice in many operations, and these devices have many applications, including ligation and division, resection, anastomosis, and fascial closure. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates surgical staplers as a medical device. Manufacturers and health-care providers report adverse events occurring during the use of surgical staplers to the FDA. STUDY DESIGN: Two FDA adverse event databases, the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and the Alternative Summary Reporting database were searched for adverse events related to the use of surgical staplers. An FDA recall database, Oracle System Center Automated Retrieval, was searched for surgical stapler recalls and the reason for these recalls. RESULTS: We characterized adverse events from 112 death, 2,180 injury, and 22,804 malfunction reports from FDA adverse event databases. We described 22 recalls for these products that are listed in an FDA database. A majority of these recalls were related to manufacturing or design problems. CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of these events remains unknown; because these products are used so frequently, even uncommon adverse events may affect many patients. It is important for health-care providers to report adverse events to manufacturers so that they may work to improve the design of these devices and reduce use errors that contribute to the events.",

    "Abstract": "In 2002, approximately 38,000 vertebroplasties and 16,000 kyphoplasties were performed in the United States. As the use of both modalities for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures has increased, so have questions regarding safety and efficacy. The authors addressed this by reviewing both the current literature and complications data reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health through the on-line database (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html) and through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the FDA. Although both procedures are largely safe, the FDA data highlight two main concerns: reactions to the use of acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate) bone cement, including hypotension and, in some cases, death, especially when multiple vertebral levels are treated in one setting; and a possible increased risk with kyphoplasty of pedicle fracture and cord compression.",

    "Title": "Cochlear implant complications: utility of federal database in systematic analysis.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the suitability of the Manufacturer User Facility and Distributor Experience (MAUDE) database (which is maintained by the Food and Drug Administration and has a mandatory reporting requirement) for systemic analysis of cochlear implant complications and treatments and, in so doing, analyze trends in cochlear implant complications for 2 periods, 2002 and pre-1998. DATA SOURCES: All events from 2002 and from before 1998 were considered. Events and action taken were categorized and tabulated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Because there was no null hypothesis, statistical analysis (chi2) was only used in comparing the 2 time frames. CONCLUSIONS: Structural limitations of the database, in addition to disparate reporting quality, made systematic analysis difficult. It was noted that spontaneous device failure accounted for the greatest single number of adverse events for both 2002 and the pre-1998 period (267/654 [41%] and 74/129 [57%], respectively), confirming earlier studies. A statistically significant decrease in spontaneous device failure and a significant increase in infections from the pre-1998 period to 2002 was observed. Flap problems ranging from extrusion to infection that required explantation were less frequently reimplanted than other problems requiring explantation, such as device failure or trauma. We considered new directions, including close collaboration with the new MedSun reporting system and conclude that while a valuable resource for narrative data, the current structure of the MAUDE database is only modestly useful for analyzing trends in complications and cannot answer several crucial questions, including device type comparisons. We suggest changing the current report format to include patient age, duration of implant, presence of anatomical abnormalities, and details on spontaneous device failures.",

    "Title": "Do split-side rails present an increased risk to patient safety?",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about the safety of split-side bed rails for patients in the UK. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether split-side rails were more likely to be associated with entrapment and injury of patients than other bed rail types. To establish whether there was a difference in the site of injury caused by different bed rail types and whether the outcome of the injury (death versus survival) varied by bedrail type. METHODS: A search of the USA Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database was carried out. The reports were screened using rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and then coded for rail type, incident outcome, and area of body involved. RESULTS: Split-side rail incidents only accounted for 5% of the reports and were more likely to involve the chest or pelvis. Although the biggest overall risk by rail type cannot be determined from these data, the severity of the outcome changed with the equipment type. Incidents involving half rails were more likely to be associated with head, neck, or face entrapments and were also more likely than other bed rail types to result in death. DISCUSSION: Split-side rail entrapments were not a common occurrence. However, our findings suggest that bed rails are associated with some level of risk of entrapment that potentially could result in death. Healthcare providers should therefore ensure that they follow the guidelines for risk assessment and rail use from the MHRA and other professional bodies so that the cultural norm in the UK continues to be \"opt in\", where no bed rails are used unless indicated by a documented clinical assessment.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to understand the causes of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) failure and complications so that adverse events, including unnecessary death, can be prevented. BACKGROUND: Sudden death may occur if an ICD fails to treat life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database was searched for ICD devices and the search term \"death.\" The search yielded 212 death events involving 100 ICD pulse generator and lead models from five manufacturers. These death events were associated with (A) ICD devices for which pulse generator interrogation data and/or the results of the manufacturers analysis of returned devices were available; (B) ICD devices for which neither interrogation data nor the results of the manufacturer's analysis were reported; and (C) normally functioning ICDs that had been deactivated. RESULTS: (A) A total of 103 (69%) of 150 death events were associated with defective pulse generators or high-voltage leads. Most (34/42 [81%]) apparently sudden or arrhythmic death events were associated with high-voltage lead failure; other deaths were related to pulse generator failure (8/42 [19%]) caused by electronic component defects. (B) A total of 21 of 51 death events were related to a manufacturer's recall; all deaths were arrhythmic but without allegation of device failure. (C) Eleven death events occurred in patients whose pulse generators were found to be off or deactivated; these devices appeared to have been deactivated accidentally or by exposure to magnetic fields, or they were not reactivated after elective surgery. CONCLUSIONS: ICD device failure and unintended pulse generator deactivation have resulted in unnecessary deaths. Although these deaths may be infrequent, improved devices and follow-up techniques are needed. The magnet deactivation feature probably is unsafe, and health professionals and patients should be cautioned.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize adverse events reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on breast pumps. Thirty-seven adverse event reports on breast pumps were identified from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 1992 and 2003. Four additional reports were found in the Device Experience Network database from 1992 to 1996. The most commonly reported adverse events for electric breast pumps were pain, soreness, or discomfort; the need for medical intervention; and breast tissue damage. Most frequently reported problems for manual breast pumps were breast tissue damage and infection. Contamination of breast milk during pumping was also reported. Breast pump adverse events are likely underreported to the FDA. Reporting adverse events is important for improving the design and manufacture of breast pumps and subsequently decreasing adverse events.",

    "Title": "Trocar-associated injuries and fatalities: an analysis of 1399 reports to the FDA.",
    "Abstract": "Laparoscopic trocars, medical devices used to gain access into the abdominal cavity, are the most common device named in malpractice injury claims associated with laparoscopic procedures. As part of its ongoing adverse event reporting program, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers and user facilities to file a report whenever a device was or may have been a factor in a death or serious injury. The FDA collects data from these reports in its Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. This study presents an analysis of fatality and injury data on laparoscopic trocars found in MAUDE reports received from January 1, 1997, through June 30, 2002, including 31 fatal injury cases and 1353 reports on nonfatal injuries. Cholecystectomy was the procedure most frequently associated with both fatal and nonfatal trocar injuries. Most fatalities involved vascular injuries. All fatality reports that identified the trocar design involved either a shielded trocar (which has a retractable shield that covers the trocar blade before and after insertion to help protect abdominal and pelvic organs from inadvertent puncture) or an optical trocar (which allows laparoscopists to view the cutting tip as it penetrates the tissues). Narrative comments cited surgical technique, device problems, and patient characteristics as contributing factors. Among nonfatal injuries, a change in surgical management such as additional surgical procedure--primarily laparotomy--prolonged surgery, or aborted surgery was reported most frequently for vascular and hollow viscus injuries. Many reports did not identify the device model, surgical procedure, or event timing, limiting Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and manufacturer investigations into whether the device contributed to the event. The most common manufacturer conclusions indicated the trocar was not returned, and no conclusions could be drawn about the trocar's contribution to the event. Fatalities occur with procedures in which shielded trocars and optical trocars are used. Further study is needed to evaluate the high proportion of reports associated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopists should retain for evaluation any devices implicated in patient injuries and should ensure that detailed information on adverse events is provided in adverse event reports to the FDA. The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database can be a valuable source for information on adverse outcomes associated with medical devices and, given an understanding of its limitation, provides researchers with a viable adjunct to published literature and litigation surveys for obtaining this information.",

We required \"MAUDE\", a database that collects reports of complications associated with medical devices and which is maintained by the Food and Drug Administration. We searched for complications associated with three different, commercially available trans-obturator slings. We then tabulated the results by type of complication, by date of occurrence, and by type of sling. Between January 2004 and July 2005, 140 reports of 173 complications associated with trans-obturator tapes were reported to the MAUDE database. Previously unreported injuries, such as obturator nerve injuries, large blood losses (>or=600cc), and ischiorectal fossa abscesses, were documented. Serious complications occur with the trans-obturator tape systems, but the rates are unknown due to database limitations. The type of complication appears to differ between devices and this may reflect different implantation systems and different polypropylene mesh formulations. Improved tracking of device complications is necessary to maximize patient safety.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endoluminal therapies are emerging as a new therapeutic option for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Many of these endoluminal therapies are touted as short outpatient procedures with minimal complications. It is thought that these complications are uncommon and minor. This investigation sought to summarize the adverse events of these endoluminal therapies for the treatment of GERD. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health Web site was searched to examine all voluntary adverse events reported on emerging endoluminal therapies. The adverse events can be divided into 3 categories: (1) radiofrequency ablation based, (2) injection based, and (3) suture based. RESULTS: There were a total of 50 adverse events reported on 4 specific therapies. Half of the complications were found to result from injection-based therapy and 44% of the complications were found to result from radiofrequency ablation-based therapy. There were 8 deaths reported (5 in the injection-based group and 3 in the radiofrequency ablation-based group). Sixty-four percent of the adverse events resulted in hospitalizations and 10% of these patients required surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians must be aware that no endoluminal therapy is truly noninvasive. Complications and even deaths are associated with these treatments for GERD. Patients must be informed of all the potential risks and complications of these new technologies.",

    "Title": "Breast implant surveillance reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: maternal-child health problems.",
    "Abstract": "There is continuing concern that women who receive breast implants may be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes or experience problems with breastfeeding. It is unknown whether exposure to biomaterials in breast implants may have teratogenic effects or leach into breast milk causing postnatalproblems. We studied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experience by analyzing a case series of adverse event reports received and entered into the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database or the Device Experience Network (DEN) database by December 31, 2002 regarding women with breast implants. Reports were critically reviewed for lactation difficulties, reproductive problems (spontaneous abortion, delayed conception) and medical conditions among offspring, including neonatal, infant, and childhood diseases and congenital defects that were attributed to implants. We identified 339 reports that described maternal-child adverse events. Nearly half of these reports (46%) described actual problems with breastfeeding or expressed concern that implants would be unsafe or interfere with breastfeeding. Forty-four percent of reports (n=149) described either nonspecific or specific signs, symptoms, or illnesses in children. An additional 3.5% of reports (n=12) detailed a congenital anomaly believed by the reporter to be caused by breast implants.",

    "Title": "Presentation and management of major complications of midurethral slings: Are complications under-reported?",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: Midurethral slings have become the mainstay of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment due to their efficacy and low complication rates. The purpose of this study was to report the presentation and treatment of major complications from these minimally invasive treatments presented to a tertiary referral practice and to highlight a discrepancy in major complications between literature and the food and drug administration (FDA) device failure database. METHODS: From 2001 through 2005, we reviewed all cases of midurethral sling complications that presented to our institution. A literature review of all complications due to midurethral slings during the same time period was performed as was the FDA manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database queried for self-reported complications. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients referred to UCLA with voiding dysfunction after sling placement was found to have mesh in the urethra or bladder. Treatments required a combination of urethrolysis with mesh removal, urethral reconstruction with graft, and bladder excision. These were compared to major complications reported in the world literature of <1%. The MAUDE database contained 161 major complications out of a total of 928 complications reported for suburethral slings. There was significantly more major complications reported in MAUDE than in published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, major complications of midurethral slings are more common than appear in literature. Devastating complications involving urethral and bladder perforations can present with mild urinary symptoms and thus are likely under-diagnosed and under-reported. Most of these cases need to be managed with additional reconstructive surgery.",

    "Title": "Severe, diffuse coronary artery spasm after drug-eluting stent placement.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Three cases of severe, diffuse coronary artery spasm after drug-eluting stent placement at our institution prompted this review. BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents have gained widespread use due to extraordinarily low rates of restenosis. Despite these generally superior clinical outcomes, the specter of rare idiosyncratic reactions remains a concern. METHODS: We performed searches of Medline and the U.S. FDA Manufacturer And User facility Device Experience database (MAUDE) to identify and describe spasm after coronary stent placement. Searches included drug-eluting and bare-metal stents. Institutional cases are reviewed. Location, time course and outcome of cases are described. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of spasm were identified after stent placement. Seven cases occurred after Cypher drug-eluting stent placement, 2 after Taxus drug-eluting stent placement, 1 after BiodivYsio and 3 after bare-metal stents. Five patients experienced diffuse, multivessel spasm--2 after Cypher, 2 after Taxus, and 1 after a Velocity stent. Of these 5 patients, 2 died. An additional 2 required intra-aortic balloon pump placement for cardiogenic shock. Another had persistent symptomatic, diffuse coronary spasm documented by angiography at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: We describe coronary spasm after stent placement, particularly after drug-eluting stents. Outcomes associated with diffuse severe spasm after stenting are poor, and the pathophysiology remains poorly understood.",

    "Title": "Reported failures of the polymer self-locking (Hem-o-lok) clip: review of data from the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: New technology has played an important role in the proliferation of laparoscopy within urology. A central issue remains meticulous hemostasis, particularly for larger vessels (e.g., renal artery and vein). This paper presents available information regarding failure of the widely utilized nonabsorbable polymer Hem-o-lok clip (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC), introduced in 1999. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health maintains a compendium of reports of adverse events involving medical devices (MAUDE). We performed multiple searches of MAUDE using a variety of key words, including Weck, Hem-o-lok, laparoscopy, nephrectomy, and clip. RESULTS: Within the MAUDE database, we identified 27 reports of problems with the Hem-o-lok clip until July 6, 2005. Of these events, only 1 (4%) involved application during open surgery, with the remainder occurring during laparoscopy. Minimal morbidity resulted from applicator difficulty during laparoscopic cholecystectomy (N = 7; 26%), with one case of open conversion. Forty-eight percent (N = 13) of the failures occurred during urologic laparoscopy; of these, bleeding was the primary problem in 77%. Delayed exploration, immediate open conversion, and death resulted in 38% (N = 5), 8% (N = 1), and 15% (N = 2), respectively. No clear etiology for the events could be found, although in all situations, multiple clips had been applied with apparent initial vessel control intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Reported difficulty with the Hem-o-lok clip occurs primarily during laparoscopic surgery. Cases of failure after laparoscopic nephrectomy require urgent exploration, although it is unclear whether device or user error is the underlying cause. Regardless, care must be taken in securing the renal vessels, surgeons must be educated regarding proper use and techniques, and consideration should be given to using transfixing techniques.",

    "Title": "Endotherapy and surgery for GERD.",
    "Abstract": "Today, there are several modalities to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (medications, endoscopic therapies, surgery) and such therapies can be used either singly, or in tandem, or in combination with the others, aiming at \"normalization\" of the patient's GERD-related quality of life and, if possible, esophageal acid exposure. Several intermediate end points or clinically significant outcomes have not been reached by some therapeutic modalities and no single modality is or can be perfect. Statistically significant improvements in these intermediate end points have been shown in \"some\" but not all studies. Although healing of esophagitis can be accomplished with either medical or surgical therapy, there is inadequate data with endotherapies, because most patients treated with endotherapies have had prior trials of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and hence healed their esophagitis. Effective prevention of complications, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, remains challenging for all modalities. Patients who have not normalized their GERD-related quality of life with once or twice daily PPI therapy should undergo functional esophageal evaluation with pH testing and esophageal motility study and they should be evaluated by both an endoscopist and a surgeon. The decision on how to proceed should be made on the basis of the criteria for endotherapy and surgery, availability of local endoscopic and surgical expertise and patients' preference. Such multimodality therapy model is in many ways similar to the long-term management of coronary artery disease where pharmacotherapy, angioplasty, and bypass surgery are frequently used in tandem or in combination. Multimodality therapy aiming at normalization of GERD-related quality of life is an option today, and should be available to all patients in need of therapy. The target population for GERD endotherapy currently consists of PPI-dependent GERD patients, who have a small (<2-cm-long) or no sliding hiatal hernia, and without severe esophagitis or Barrett esophagus. Thus far, only Stretta and the NDO plicator have been studied in sham-controlled trials. Registries of complications suggest that these techniques are relatively safe, but serious morbidity, including rare mortality have been reported (for a continuous update on complications related to endoscopic therapies see: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html). All can be performed on an outpatient basis, under intravenous sedation and local pharyngeal anesthesia. Future comparative studies with predetermined clinically significant end points, validated outcome measures, prolonged follow-up, and complete complication registries will eventually determine the precise role of endoscopic procedures for the patients with GERD.",

    "Title": "Early failure of a small-diameter high-voltage implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We have observed a higher than expected rate of Sprint Fidelis model 6949 lead failures in our practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of small-diameter Sprint Fidelis high-voltage ICD leads. METHODS: The actuarial survival of Sprint Fidelis model 6949 leads implanted at our center was compared with that of the Sprint Quattro Secure model 6947. The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for Sprint Fidelis models. RESULTS: The survival of 583 Sprint Fidelis 6949 leads implanted at our center between September 2004 and February 2007 was significantly less than 285 Sprint Quattro Secure model 6947 leads implanted by us between November 2001 and February 2007 (P = .005). Six patients presented with Sprint Fidelis lead failure 4-23 months after implant. Five of the six patients experienced multiple inappropriate shocks associated with pace-sense conductor and coil fractures; the sixth patient had a fixation mechanism failure. The MAUDE search rendered reports for 679 Sprint Fidelis leads. The most frequent complaints or observations were inappropriate shocks (33%), high impedance (33%), and fracture (35%). Of 125 leads analyzed by the manufacturer, 62 involved fracture of the pace-sense conductor or coil and the high-voltage (defibrillation) conductor. CONCLUSIONS: The Sprint Fidelis high-voltage lead appears to be prone to early failure. Its use should be limited until the failure mechanism is identified and corrected. Patients should be evaluated quarterly, and automatic lead test features should be enabled. While more data are needed, routine prophylactic replacement of intact, normally functioning Sprint Fidelis leads does not appear justified.",

    "Title": "Adverse events involving intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: This article systematically characterizes aspects of all Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) reports associated with i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperative use during a two-year index period. METHODS: Intravenous PCA represents a well-accepted and satisfactory means of acute pain treatment; case reports and large case series have described the occurrence of i.v. PCA-related adverse drug events (ADEs). MAUDE data files were downloaded, and all records pertaining to i.v. PCA devices were extracted for the two-year period from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003. Medical device events were categorized by their reported cause, including patient-related event, device safety event, operator error, and adverse reactions to opioids. Because there was not sufficient information to grade the certainty of each reported cause, all reported causes were graded \"possible,\" except for device safety events that were confirmed on inspection by the manufacturer. RESULTS: There were 2009 individual i.v. PCA-related MAUDE medical device events reported during the two-year period. Of these events, 1590 (79.1%) were classified as possible device safety events, 131 (6.5%) as possible operator error, 25 (1.2%) as possible adverse reactions to opioids, 12 (0.6%) as possible patient-related events, and 235 (11.7%) as indeterminate. CONCLUSION: Manufacturer-confirmed device malfunction was a major cause of reported ADE with i.v. PCA infusion pumps while operator errors were more likely to be associated with more serious adverse outcomes than device safety problems. To reduce the incidence of these problems, potential vulnerabilities in the design and manufacture of i.v. PCA pumps must be identified and addressed.",

    "Abstract": "Our objective was to evaluate complications reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and to look for trends of complications among various endometrial ablation devices. This database was not intended to be used either to evaluate rates of adverse events or to compare adverse event occurrence rates across devices. We performed a retrospective review of the Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database. The database was queried for adverse events associated with the use of endometrial ablation devices. The following data were collected: event number, date reported, date of occurrence, type of ablation device, type of complication, adherence to manufacturer's protocol, brief description, disposition, who reported incident, report source, and cause of problem. The total number of adverse events reported in the United States for the time period January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006, was 254. The largest number of major complications for cryoablation was bowel injury (n = 5), for microwave was bowel injury (n = 6), for hot water balloon was complications leading to hysterectomy (n = 7), for free circulating hot water was severe burns (n = 22), and for bipolar mesh was bowel injury (n = 19). The MAUDE database is useful to both the physician and manufacturer to look at trends and types of complications.",

    "Title": "Mechanisms of hemostatic failure during laparoscopic nephrectomy: review of Food and Drug Administration database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the complications with endovascular stapling devices, nonlocking titanium clips, and nonabsorbable polymer ligating (Hem-o-lok) clips during laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database was retrospectively reviewed for reports dated from January 1992 to March 2006 using the key words \"nephrectomy\" and \"kidney.\" All episodes of pure and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 2172 total nephrectomy or kidney-related reports, 352 reported failure using laparoscopic hemostatic devices to secure the renal vasculature, and 223 complications (63%) resulted during the use of endovascular stapling devices, 111 (33%) from nonlocking titanium clips and 18 (5%) from locking clips. The leading causes of failure reported in stapling devices were staple line malformation (47%) and locking up (29%). In titanium clips, jamming/feeding difficulties (27%) and trouble closing or \"scissoring\" clips (26%) were the most common. In locking clips, dislodgement (44%) was most frequently reported. Three, one, and three deaths were reported after the use of the stapling device, titanium clip, and locking clip device, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All three methods used to secure the renal hilum in laparoscopic nephrectomy can result in malfunction. Because the overall denominator of use is not known, it would be inappropriate to conclude that one device is safer than another. When they occurred, these device malfunctions were potentially serious. Knowledge of the possible mechanisms of failure seen with each device could allow surgeons to anticipate potential complications and, therefore, perform laparoscopic surgery more safely.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the occurrence of electrode migration after cochlear implantation. STUDY DESIGN: Review of public database and retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center, ambulatory. PATIENTS: Retrospective review of electrode migration reported in association with the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and a single-institution case series between 1996 and 2006. INTERVENTION: Cochlear implantation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Occurrence of electrode migration. RESULTS: During the period 1996 to 2006, 151 reports of electrode migration were filed in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The most common association with migration was cochlear ossification, although 127 of 151 cases had no known association. During an equivalent period, 637 cochlear implant (CI) procedures were performed at the University of Miami. Of 580 primary CI operations, 2 cases of electrode migration were identified, both associated with reossification of a cochlea that was fully ossified at the first procedure. CONCLUSION: Electrode migration is an underrecognized complication of CI surgery and may be associated with cochlear ossification. Electrode stabilization techniques may reduce the incidence of CI electrode migration in nonossified or incompletely ossified cases.",

Three inferior vena cava (IVC) filters (Gunther Tulip, Bard Recovery, and the Cordis OptEase) were compared on the basis of design characteristics associated with function, shape, number of trapping levels, and fixation. Adverse events reported in the literature and to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) were summarized. The major differences among device types include the fixation, the volume and number of trapping levels, and the amount of metal in the IVC. The MAUDE registry reported adverse events that had been hypothesized from the analysis of in vitro and in vivo testing. The Recovery and OptEase filters had the highest number of clinically important reports. From 12 to 57% were retrieved between 3 days and 11 months. Adaptations made to facilitate retrieval led to unacceptable sequelae. The small number removed, the length of time they are left in place, and the risks associated with retrieval suggest that optional filters may not be equivalent to approved permanent devices.",

    "Title": "Device failures associated with patient injuries during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgeries: a comprehensive review of FDA MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has increased in the areas of cardiac and urologic surgery. We sought to determine the number of reported device malfunctions leading to patient injuries. METHODS: We performed a review of the MAUDE database of the FDA. Adverse events (AE) were defined as potential and actual product use errors and product quality problems. All incidents involving the ZEUS and da Vinci surgical robots were analyzed. RESULTS: The MAUDE database was last accessed on August 27, 2007. A total of 189 AEs were reported from 2000 to August 27, 2007. Assuming that 50,000 robotic-assisted laparoscopic cases have been performed, this represents 0.38% overall estimated failure rate. Twenty-one malfunctions were reported for the ZEUS robotic system between 2001 and 2003, while 168 malfunctions were reported for the da Vinci robotic system between 2000 and 2007. The rate of open conversions due to device malfunction decreased from 94% in 2003 to 16% in 2007. Of the 189 reported device malfunctions, only 9 (4.8%) were associated with patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing use of robotic-assisted surgery has led to an increase in the number of reported device malfunctions, albeit at a very small estimated rate of 0.38%. With experience, the rate of open conversions due to device malfunction decreased. Only a small percentage of these adverse occurrences were associated with patient injury.",

    "Title": "A comprehensive review of suburethral sling procedure complications.",
    "Abstract": "The study objective was to review the existing literature regarding complications of anti-incontinence sling procedures. PubMed listings using keywords related to slings and associated complications with no date or language restrictions through May 2007 and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database were searched for specific device- and procedure-related complications. Where no information was available, published abstracts were cited. Published reports of complications for all types of anti-incontinence sling procedures are analyzed and reported. Sling-related complications are multiple but can be summarized from studies on 13737 cumulative patients as involving: voiding dysfunction (8 studies, 881 patients, 16.3% average overall incidence [OI]); detrusor overactivity (20 studies, 1950 patients, 15.4% OI); urinary retention (14 studies, 943 patients, 14.2% OI); erosion/extrusion (19 studies, 2197 patients, 6.03% OI); impact on quality of life-dyspareunia (2 studies, 175 patients, 4.3% OI); infections-most often urinary tract infections but severe infections such as abscess are reported (19 studies, 1487 patients, 5.5% OI); hematoma-most often pelvic or vaginal (4 studies, 3691 patients, 2% OI); pain (6 studies, 597 patients, 7.3% OI); abdominal and pelvic organ injury-bladder, urethra, vagina, and intestines (10 studies, 1816 patients, 3.3% OI); systemic complications-deep vein thrombosis, sepsis (case reports); and death (case reports). Cure rates for all slings are as follows: subjective (16 studies, 1541 patients, 95% OI, range 63%-99%), objective (15 studies, 1203 patients, 82% OI, range 51%-97%), and failure (8 studies, 599 patients, 11.5% OI, range 4%-37%). It is likely that sling-related complications are under-reported in the published medical literature and in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database. This review reports on the incidence of known complications for all types of slings. Some complications are common to all sling techniques; however, with development of minimally invasive slings, device-related complications are reported and compared.",

    "Abstract": "During the past 3 years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received a growing number of adverse event reports on the breakage or fracturing and retention of anesthetic conduction device tips with associated complications. Serious injuries and other problems such as spinal stenosis, nerve root compression, and subcutaneous effusion can result. Several case reports demonstrate how the problems occur; some illustrate the severity of the problem. All cases are from adverse event reports in the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Frequently, in the interest of not causing patient harm, a device fragment might not be removed as long as the patient is not neurologically compromised or at risk for infection or there is little potential for migration of the fragmented piece. On many occasions, the fragments remain in patients without their knowledge. The FDA wants to raise awareness of the problem and its potential impact in creating complications, encourage the practice of informing patients of the fragmented device, and promote reporting of such incidents to CDRH via the MedWatch reporting system. Based on a search of the current literature, recommendations for prevention are suggested.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recently, several large series of robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) have described a low incidence of bladder neck contractures (BNC). We have had a similar experience at our institution. Our objective is to describe our experience with BNC after RALP and a novel relationship to the use of Hem-o-lok Clips (HOLC). METHODS: We reviewed a database of patients who underwent RALP at our institution from January 2004 to September 2007 and identified patients with BNC or complications related to the use of HOLC. We performed a retrospective chart review to attempt to determine the cause of each BNC. We also performed a PubMed search and review of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: Of 524 patients undergoing RALP, 4 had a BNC develop, 2 of the BNCs were associated with HOLC migration and erosion into the vesicourethral anastomosis, and 1 was found to have HOLC migration within the bladder. A fifth patient had an anastomotic leak develop secondary to a HOLC that migrated into the bladder neck. Two similar cases of HOLC-related migration have been reported to MAUDE. CONCLUSIONS: When early BNC or unexplained urinary retention occurs after RALP, one should have a high index of suspicion for migration of HOLC. Clip use should be minimized on tissue immediately adjacent to the anastomosis, and every effort should be made to retrieve loose clips after the procedure.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize major complications and outcome for patients receiving percutaneous closure of atrial septal communications. DESIGN: The Medline database and the United States Food and Drug Administration manufacturer and user facility device experience databases (MAUDE) were searched for reports related to complications with atrial septal occluding devices. The medical literature documenting complication rates for these devices were reviewed and summarized. The MAUDE database complication reports were compared with those reported in the medical literature using national implant estimates. OUTCOME: The MAUDE database correlated in the type of complications most frequently encountered with each device. However, based on estimated total implant numbers, there is a higher incidence of major complications, including death. AGA devices had a 0.3% erosion/perforation rate with a higher morbidity and mortality (29%) than previously reported. NMT devices had a lower incidence of erosion/perforation rate of 0.05%. Embolization rates for the NMT devices were also lower than published European studies, possibly reflecting the US restriction of the device for closure of patent foramen ovale. Thrombus was more frequently encountered on the NMT device. Both AGA and NMT devices have been shown to be safe and effective alternatives to cardiac surgery. The MAUDE database correlated, with a very low overall complication rate, but showed a higher estimated major complication rate than the medical literature. These data demonstrate the difficulty in quantifying rare complications in the premarketing analysis and the obligation providers have to report and evaluate complications through vigilant postmarketing surveillance.",

    "Title": "Adolescent use of insulin and patient-controlled analgesia pump technology: a 10-year Food and Drug Administration retrospective study of adverse events.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: From January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration received 5 adolescent death reports associated with the use of insulin pumps, raising concerns about use of this device in this age group. To understand better the types of infusion pump-related problems in adolescents, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of insulin and patient-controlled analgesic pump-related adverse events reported for adolescents that were received by the Food and Drug Administration from 1996 to 2005. METHODS: A search for medical device adverse event reports from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2005, involving insulin pumps or patient-controlled analgesic pumps used by patients who were aged 12 to 21 years was conducted in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database. Reports were reviewed for demographic characteristics, type of adverse event, and patient morbidity, and potential contributory factors were classified from narratives in the reports. RESULTS: A total of 1674 reports were identified: 1594 for insulin pumps and 53 for patient-controlled analgesic pumps. In reports of insulin pump events, there were 13 reported deaths, 2 reports that indicated possible suicide attempts, and several additional reports indicating severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events that seemed to be device-related. A total of 102 (6.4%) insulin-pump reports highlighted factors that may have contributed to the adverse event, including problems associated with compliance, education, sports-related activities, and dropping or damaging the pump. Eighty-two percent of cases involving the insulin pump resulted in hospitalization. Half of the reports involving patient-controlled analgesic pumps indicated that the patient received an excess of medication; tampering and noncompliance were evident in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents are a special population who deserve careful consideration of risk and benefit for use of device technology. Studies need to further identify safety problems in this age group.",

    "Title": "The NTI-tss device for the therapy of bruxism, temporomandibular disorders, and headache - where do we stand? A qualitative systematic review of the literature.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The NTI-tss device is an anterior bite stop, which, according to the manufacturer, is indicated for the prevention and treatment of bruxism, temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), tension-type headaches, and migraine. The aim of this systematic review was to appraise the currently available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the NTI-tss splint. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in nine electronic databases and in NTI-tss-associated websites (last update: December 31, 2007). The reference lists of all relevant articles were perused. Five levels of scientific quality were distinguished. Reporting quality of articles about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was evaluated using the Jadad score. To identify adverse events, we searched in the identified publications and in the MAUDE database. RESULTS: Nine of 68 relevant publications reported about the results of five different RCTs. Two RCTs concentrated on electromyographic (EMG) investigations in patients with TMDs and concomitant bruxism (Baad-Hansen et al 2007, Jadad score: 4) or with bruxism alone (Kavakli 2006, Jadad score: 2); in both studies, compared to an occlusal stabilization splint the NTI-tss device showed significant reduction of EMG activity. Two RCTs focused exclusively on TMD patients; in one trial (Magnusson et al 2004, Jadad score: 3), a stabilization appliance led to greater improvement than an NTI-tss device, while in the other study (Jokstad et al 2005, Jadad score: 5) no difference was found. In one RCT (Shankland 2002, Jadad score: 1), patients with tension-type headache or migraine responded more favorably to the NTI-tss splint than to a bleaching tray. NTI-tss-induced complications related predominantly to single teeth or to the occlusion. CONCLUSION: Evidence from RCTs suggests that the NTI-tss device may be successfully used for the management of bruxism and TMDs. However, to avoid potential unwanted effects, it should be chosen only if certain a patient will be compliant with follow-up appointments. The NTI-tss bite splint may be justified when a reduction of jaw closer muscle activity (e.g., jaw clenching or tooth grinding) is desired, or as an emergency device in patients with acute temporomandibular pain and, possibly, restricted jaw opening.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanisms of failure and patient outcomes during complications with the use of endoscopic stapling devices, nonlocking titanium clips, and locking polymer clips during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's medical device complication database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE), was evaluated for pure and hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomies from 1992 to 2007 with the broadest keywords possible. In an attempt to estimate the failure rates by device type, a \"denominator of use\" was calculated using Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data multiplied by previously published survey-determined usage rates. RESULTS: In the 92 complications identified, 59 (64%), 21 (23%), and 12 (13%) failures of endoscopic staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips had occurred, respectively. The most common mechanisms of stapler failure were missing/malformed staple lines (51%) and failure to release (25%). The most common titanium clip failures resulted from scissoring or malformation (52%), jamming (19%), and dislodgement (14%). Clip dislodgement was most common with the locking clip, either postoperatively in 7 (58%) or intraoperatively in 3 (25%). Intraoperative conversions were required for 21 (36%), 1 (5%), and 2 (17%) for staplers, titanium clips, and locking clips, respectively. The estimated overall failure rate was 3.0% for staplers, 4.9% for titanium clips, and 1.7% for locking clips. CONCLUSIONS: The anticipation of potential device-specific failures during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, coupled with knowledge of how to handle failure when it does occur, could improve procedure safety.",

    "Title": "Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for adverse events involving Amplatzer septal occluder devices and comparison with the Society of Thoracic Surgery congenital cardiac surgery database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Amplatzer (AGA Medical Corporation, Plymouth, Minn) septal and vascular occluder devices have significantly altered the care of patients with congenital heart disease. The relative frequency and consequence of complications resulting from the attempted placement of such devices, however, have not been well assessed. The purpose of this study is to use large databases to assess the frequency and severity of such complications and compare them with those of surgical atrial septal defect closure. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was quarried for all adverse events for Amplatzer septal occluder devices, which were categorized and analyzed with particular emphasis on management and outcome. The Society of Thoracic Surgery database was likewise quarried for the same data regarding atrial septal defect closures over a contemporaneous time period. By using a literature-derived denominator for total Amplatzer implant numbers, the results of the 2 therapies were compared. RESULTS: Since July 1, 2002, 223 adverse events in patients undergoing Amplatzer atrial septal defect closure were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, resulting in 17 deaths (7.6%) and 152 surgical rescue operations (68.2%). Society of Thoracic Surgery data demonstrated 1537 primary operations with 2 deaths (0.13%) and 6 reoperations (0.39%). By extrapolating on published estimates of Amplatzer implantation to provide an implant denominator (n = 18,333), there was no difference between overall mortality for surgical (0.13%) and device closure (0.093%, P = .649). Rescue operation for device adverse events (0.83%) was 2.1 times more likely than reoperation for surgical closure (0.39%, P = .063). Mortality per adverse event was higher for device closure (7.6%) than for surgical closure (1.2%, P = .004), and the need for surgery per adverse event was higher for device closure (68.2%) than for surgical closure (3.6%, P < .001). The mortality for surgical management of a device adverse event (2.6%) was 20-fold higher than for primary elective atrial septal defect closure (0.13%, P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Overall crude mortality for device and surgical closure atrial septal defect closure is equivalent, and the need for subsequent operation (surgical rescue) is more common in patients undergoing device closure than reoperation is in patients undergoing surgical closure. Complications from device closure tend to be serious and most often require urgent or emergency operative management, whereas the mortality for surgical management of a device complication appears higher than that of elective atrial septal defect closure. Further information is required in the form of postmarketing surveillance, such as a mandatory user registry with periodic end-user notification.",

    "Title": "Ambulance stretcher adverse events.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ambulance personnel use wheeled stretchers for moving patients in the out-of-hospital setting. The nature of adverse events and associated injuries occurring during ambulance stretcher operation was characterised. METHODS: Data from the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) were used. All adverse events involving ambulance stretchers during the years 1996-2005 were identified. The nature of the event, the method of stretcher handling, the individuals injured and the nature of the resulting injuries were identified. RESULTS: There were 671 reported adverse events. The most common adverse events were stretcher collapse (54%; 95% CI 50 to 57%), broken, missing or malfunctioning part (28%; 95% CI 25 to 32%) and dropped stretcher (7%; 95% CI 5 to 9%). Adverse events most commonly occurred during unloading of the stretcher from the ambulance (16%; 13 to 19%). Injuries occurred in 121 events (18%; 95% CI 15 to 21%), most often involving sprains/strains (29%), fractures (16%) and lacerations/avulsions (13%). There were three traumatic brain injuries and three deaths. Patients sustained injuries in 52 events (43%), and ambulance personnel sustained injuries in 64 events (53%). More than one individual sustained injuries in 12 events. CONCLUSION: Adverse events may occur during ambulance stretcher operation and can result in significant injury to patients and ambulance personnel.",

    "Title": "Patient-controlled analgesia-related medication errors in the postoperative period: causes and prevention.",
    "Abstract": "Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a common and effective means of managing postoperative pain. Unfortunately, the complex processes and equipment associated with the setup, programming and administration of intravenous or epidural PCA have allowed it to become a significant source of preventable medication errors. These errors can be classified into two major categories: human (operator) errors and equipment errors (malfunctions). Such errors are potentially harmful to patients, time-consuming for hospital staff and costly for healthcare providers. The objective of this article is to describe PCA medication errors and examine systems and modalities that may help reduce the incidence of system-related errors. Data from the US FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database indicate that 6.5% of intravenous PCA-related events were due to operator error. Most (81%) of these errors were due to pump misprogramming, of which almost half were associated with patient harm; 76.4% of adverse events were attributed to device malfunction (e.g. due to frayed wires or a crack in the drug cartridge), although only 0.5% of these were associated with harm to patients. In a report based on data from MEDMARX, a voluntary database that captures reports on medication errors, 7.9% of the PCA-related errors captured over a 5-year period were described as causing harm to patients. Technological advances, such as improved PCA pump designs based on ergonomic and cognitive engineering principles, the use of barcode technology and other 'smart pump' safety features, and new postoperative pain management modalities, may play a significant role in reducing the future incidence and severity of PCA medication errors.",

    "Title": "Drug-eluting stent fracture and acute coronary syndrome.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary stent fracture is an underrecognized entity but has been reported more frequently in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era. Nevertheless, the clinical implications of coronary stent fracture remain unclear. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A literature search for reports of DES fracture was conducted via MEDLINE, and the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was accessed via the internet and interrogated for reports of stent fracture between January 1, 2003, and April 30, 2008. Each report was reviewed, and clinical information was extracted for analysis. RESULTS: The MEDLINE search identified 202 cases of coronary DES fracture, with 95% of cases involving Cypher sirolimus-eluting stents. Clinical information regarding patient presentation was available in 96 cases. Patients presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or stent thrombosis in six cases (6%) and with unstable angina or non-STEMI (NSTEMI) in 40 cases (42%). The MAUDE database search identified 337 stent fracture reports, with 97% of cases involving Cypher stents. Clinical information regarding patient presentation was available 193 cases. Patients presented with STEMI or stent thrombosis in 24 cases (12%) and with unstable angina or NSTEMI in 36 cases (19%). CONCLUSIONS: Most reports of drug-eluting stent fracture involve Cypher stents. DES fracture can be associated with stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction and angina. However, whether the incidence of such events reported in the literature and in the MAUDE database is representative of all patients experiencing stent fracture remains unclear.",

    "Title": "Indoor tanning injuries: an evaluation of FDA adverse event reporting data.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: In 1979 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated indoor tanning units would be regulated medical devices and that each must have an exposure timer. In 1985 FDA added a scheduled series of doses designed to allow tanning with little risk of concomitant sunburn. Subsequently FDA/CDRH maintained databases in which medical device associated injuries were reported. The databases, MAUDE and its predecessor MDR, are available online. While these records, in part, are not intended for evaluation of adverse event rates, analysis provides insight into the etiology of UV-related tanning injuries. METHODS/RESULTS: We compiled 142 records reported for 1985-2006 including 22% noninjury malfunctions. Of the reported injuries approximately 50% resulted from UV exposure, an average of <1/year resulted in hospitalization. At least 36% of the UV-related injuries were attributable to various (user/operator) noncompliance with FDA sunlamp guidance policies. During 1985-1995 there were six times more UV injuries than 1996-2006, presumably reflecting cessation of much mandatory reporting in 1996. Injury reports declined steady from 1997 to 2006. CONCLUSIONS: FDA guidance appears most efficacious in injury prevention and we encourage its incorporation into the enforceable performance standard. We also advise that tanning industry professional training programs seek standardization/accreditation of their personnel certifications through recognized accreditation bodies such as ANSI or ISO/IEC.",

    "Abstract": "After more than 25 years of research and development, in October 2006 ArteFill became the first and only permanent injectable wrinkle filler to receive FDA approval. ArteFill is a third-generation polymeric microsphere-based filler, following its predecessor Artecoll, which was marketed outside the United States between 1994 and 2006. ArteFill is approved for the correction of nasolabial folds and has been used in over 15,000 patients since its U.S. market introduction in February 2007. No serious side effects have been reported to date according to the FDA's MAUDE reporting database. ArteFill consists of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres (20% by volume), 30-50 microm in diameter, suspended in 3.5% bovine collagen solution (80% by volume) and 0.3% lidocaine. The collagen carrier is absorbed within 1 month after injection and completely replaced by the patient's own connective tissue within 3 months. Each cc of ArteFill contains approximately six million microspheres and histological studies have shown that long-term wrinkle correction consists of 80% of the patient's own connective tissue and 20% microspheres. The standard injection technique is subdermal tunneling that delivers a strand of ArteFill at the dermal-subdermal junction. This strand beneath a wrinkle or fold acts like a support structure that protects against further wrinkling and allows the diminished thickness of the dermis to recover to its original thickness.",

    "Title": "Deaths and cardiovascular injuries due to device-assisted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and pacemaker lead extraction.",
    "Abstract": "AIMS: An estimated 10,000-15,000 pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads are extracted annually worldwide using specialized tools that disrupt encapsulating fibrous tissue. Additional information is needed regarding the safety of the devices that have been approved for lead extraction. The aim of this study was to determine whether complications due to device-assisted lead extraction might be more hazardous than published data suggest, and whether procedural safety precautions are effective. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturers and User Defined Experience (MAUDE) database from 1995 to 2008 using the search terms 'lead extraction and death' and 'lead extraction and injury'. Additional product specific searches were performed for the terms 'death' and 'injury'. Between 1995 and 2008, 57 deaths and 48 serious cardiovascular injuries associated with device-assisted lead extraction were reported to the FDA. Owing to underreporting, the FDA database does not contain all adverse events that occurred during this period. Of the 105 events, 27 deaths and 13 injuries occurred in 2007-2008. During these 2 years, 23 deaths were linked with excimer laser or mechanical dilator sheath extractions. The majority of deaths and injuries involved ICD leads, and most were caused by lacerations of the right atrium, superior vena cava, or innominate vein. Overall, 62 patients underwent emergency surgical repair of myocardial perforations and venous lacerations and 35 (56%) survived. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that device-assisted lead extraction is a high-risk procedure and that serious complications including death may not be mitigated by emergency surgery. However, skilled standby cardiothoracic surgery is essential when performing pacemaker and ICD lead extractions. Although the incidence of these complications is unknown, the results of our study imply that device-assisted lead extractions should be performed by highly qualified physicians and their teams in specialized centres.",

    "Title": "Clinical relevance and treatment of carotid stent fractures.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review all published reports and investigate the clinical relevance and need for treatment of carotid stent fractures. METHODS: Electronic and hand-searching of the published literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were published. There are 10 case reports and 3 clinical studies. There are 26 reports of fractured stents in the MAUDE database. Fifty-five cases of carotid stent fractures are reported in total. A total of 201 carotid stents were examined in the 3 studies, and the incidence of fractures was 8.9% (18/201). Fractured stents were 22 Xact, 20 Acculink, 6 Precise, 2 Exponent, 1 Nexstent, 1 Genesis, 1 Symbiot, and 2 nonspecified nitinol self-expandable stents. Twenty-seven of the treated carotid lesions were atherosclerotic, 3 restenoses after carotid endarterectomy, 2 postradiational, 1 pseudoaneurysm, and 22 lesions of unknown pathology. Calcification was reported in 15 of the 27 atherosclerotic lesions (55.5%). Time from implantation to fracture ranged from 0 days (fracture during implantation) to 37 months. In 55% of the cases, stent fracture was associated with restenosis. Six patients presented with symptoms. Treatment was reported for 32 patients: 14 patients underwent de novo stent placement, 2 balloon angioplasty, 2 carotid endarterectomy, 2 bypass graft (1 vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene), 1 anticoagulation, and 11 patients were followed up. CONCLUSION: Carotid stent fractures are mainly reported in self-expandable nitinol stents. Plaque calcification may be a risk factor for stent fractures. No difference was observed between open and closed-cell design. Stent fractures were often associated with restenosis and usually were asymptomatic. The actual incidence, clinical relevance, and optimal treatment remain to be clarified from larger prospective studies designed to investigate the issue.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the implications of falsely elevated glucose readings measured with glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) test strips. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a review of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and medical literature for adverse events (AEs) associated with falsely elevated glucose readings with GDH-PQQ test strips in the presence of interfering sugars. RESULTS: Eighty-two reports were identified: 16 (20%) were associated with death, 46 (56%) with severe hypoglycemia, and 12 (15%) with nonsevere hypoglycemia. In eight reports (10%), the AE was not described. Forty-two events (51%) occurred in the U.S. Although most events occurred in hospitalized patients, at least 14 (17%) occurred in outpatients. Agents most commonly associated with AEs were icodextrin-containing peritoneal dialysate and maltose-containing intravenous immune globulin. CONCLUSIONS: GDH-PQQ test strips pose a safety risk to insulin-using patients treated with agents containing or metabolized to interfering sugars.",

Evidence-based methodology is used by performing a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent preclinical and clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but, in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through August 2009 by using the keywords \"interventional endoscopic ultrasound,\" \"EUS,\" and \"interventional endoscopy.\" Reports on Emerging Technologies are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. These reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes.

    "Title": "Minimizing occupational hazards in endoscopy: personal protective equipment, radiation safety, and ergonomics.",
    "Abstract": "The ASGE Technology Committee provides reviews of existing, new, or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, by using a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. When financial guidance is indicated, the most recent coding data and list prices at the time of publication are provided. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through August 2009 for articles related to personal protection equipment by using the key words \"personal protection equipment\" (exp Protective Clothing/ or exp Protective Devices/ or exp Masks/ or exp Occupational Exposure/'') \"infection control\" paired with \"Endoscopy.\" For the radiation section, the following key words were used: \"radiation and endoscopy,\" \"radiation and ERCP,\" and \"radiation safety.\" For the ergonomics section, the following key words were used: \"ergonomics of endoscopy,\" \"endoscopist injury,\" \"medical ergonomics,\" \"endoscopy and musculoskeletal strain,\" \"musculoskeletal injury and endoscopists,\" \"occupational diseases and endoscopy,\" \"cumulative trauma disorder and endoscopy,\" \"repetitive strain injury and endoscopy.\" Technology Status Evaluation Reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Title": "Stent fracture in the coronary and peripheral arteries.",
    "Abstract": "Inherent risks of stenting include restenosis and thrombosis. Recently, stent fractures have been recognized as a complication that may result in thrombosis, perforation, restenosis, and migration of the stent resulting in morbidity and mortality. Stent fractures were originally seen in the superficial femoral arteries but have since then been reported in almost all vascular sites including the coronary, renal, carotid, iliac, and femoropopliteal arteries. Fractures are the result of the complex interplay between stent manufacturing, the stented segment, pulsatile and nonpulsatile biomechanical forces, and plaque morphology at a particular vascular site. The presentation of a patient with a fracture is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic in nature, detected on routine screening without any sequelae, to sudden cardiac death related to a thrombosed coronary artery. Despite being recognized as an important complication, consensus on routine surveillance and diagnostic methods to detect fractures continues to be lacking. Fortunately, most cases are relatively benign and can be managed conservatively if detected. In the setting of recurrent symptoms, further intervention is usually sought. In review of the literature most cases are managed with placement of a stent over the fractured area, the stent-in-stent technique, but several other alternatives may be available. As the knowledge of the variables that make stents prone to fracture are identified, better technologies and techniques can be employed to minimize the risk of this complication. This article reviews the available literature on stent fractures and complications using data found on PubMed, MEDLINE, the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, and the Cochrane databases.",

    "Abstract": "The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Technology Committee provides reviews of existing, new, or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, with a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. When financial guidance is indicated, the most recent coding data and list prices at the time of publication are provided. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through January 2010 for articles related to endoscopic tattooing by using the Keywords tattooing, colonic, endoscopic, India ink, indocyanine green in different search term combinations. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Trans-radial cardiac catheterization has lower rates of arterial access site complications. Hydrophilic-coated sheaths designed specifically for trans-radial procedures have resulted in numerous reports of a foreign body reaction to retained material. Although this is a self-limited condition that should be managed expectantly, it is often confused with an infected pseudoaneurysm, resulting in unnecessary surgery. We searched the FDA MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database to determine which brands of sheath have been associated with this complication. In addition, we performed a literature search for all reported cases of this complication. Only one brand of sheath has been associated with this condition. As trans-radial procedures become more common in the US, knowledge of such complications, which appear to be specific to the Cook radial hydrophilic-coated sheaths, is imperative for all radial interventionalists to prevent unnecessary surgical procedures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

    "Title": "Complications of stone baskets: 14-year review of the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We categorized trends in failure of the stone baskets as reported in the United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried the online database using the code for stone baskets (FFL) from January 1996 to December 2009. Variables extracted were the type of basket, malfunction and treatment, and patient outcome. RESULTS: We identified 556 adverse events related to stone baskets. The device configuration was tipped in 48% of cases, tipless in 36%, forceps in 8% and the Stone Cone™ in 8%. Malfunction type included detachment of a portion of the basket in 49% of cases, breakage without detachment in 39% and inability to withdraw the basket in 12%. Compared to the early period studied (1996 to 2004) there was a 3-fold increase in adverse events from 2005 to 2007 and a 6-fold increase from 2008 to 2009. Of adverse events 79% and 11% were managed by endoscopy and open surgery, respectively. Of the patients 42 experienced serious complications requiring major surgery, including ureteral reconstruction in 7, reimplantation in 4 and nephrectomy in 7. CONCLUSIONS: With the increased use of stone baskets in the upper collecting system the number of adverse events has increased. Urologists should remain vigilant to prevent, recognize and manage these events.",

    "Abstract": "The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Technology Committee provides reviews of new or emerging endoscopic technologies that have the potential to have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, with a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent preclinical and clinical studies on the topic, and a MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience; U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized but, in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through January 2010 using the keywords \"computer,\" \"computerized,\" \"computer-assisted,\" \"sedation,\" \"propofol.\" Reports on Emerging Technology are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. These reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Reports on Emerging Technology are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To fulfill the promise of information technology in health care, automation must be made into a “team player.” Methods: Observational research in both the laboratory and field focused on how subjects program infusion devices. These programming activities were examined in detail for a set of tasks, using experienced clinicians as subjects. Observations were validated using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) incident reports and field studies. Results: The laboratory study shows that difficulties arise from poor coordination between the operator and the device as a result of device complexity. These findings are consistent with reports of device programming problems in the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE ) database. Conclusions: Problems with infusion devices are the result of difficulties that operators have with complex devices and their programming. Opportunities to improve device reliability lie primarily in improving the interface design, such as by making the device's state evident and improving menu structure navigation.",

    "Title": "Evaluating and Predicting Patient Safety for Medical Devices with\nIntegral Information Technology",
    "Abstract": "Human errors in medical device use account for a large portion of medical errors. Most of these errors are due to inappropriate designs for user interactions, rather than mechanical failures. Evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical device use is critical for developing interventions to reduce such errors either by redesigning the devices or, if redesign is not an option, by training the users on the identified trouble spots in the devices. We developed two methods for evaluating and predicting patient safety in medical devices with integral information technology, then applied and tested them on several infusion pumps. The first method is a modified discount-usability method called heuristic evaluation. The method was used to evaluate and compare the safety of two 1-channel volumetric infusion pumps. The results show that heuristic evaluation, when modified for medical devices, is a useful, efficient, and low-cost method for evaluating patient safety features of medical devices through the identification of usability problems and their severities. The second method is an extended hierarchical task analysis (EHTA), devised to predict medical errors in medical device use. EHTA divides the task space between the external world of the device interface and the internal cognitive world of the user, allowing for descriptive predictions of potential user errors at the human device level. Its use is demonstrated in the analysis of two infusion pumps. The estimates of the likelihood of user errors with the two pumps are consistent with the corresponding reported use errors in the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this tool for predicting medical device use errors.",

    "Title": "Relationship between drain volume/fill volume ratio and clinical outcomes associated with overfill complaints in peritoneal dialysis patients.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To better understand the spectrum of overfill reports and their corresponding clinical severity and etiology, we conducted a review of overfill reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, which is within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site (www.fda.gov). METHOD: We searched the MAUDE database for events related to overfill reports between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2008 and recorded drain volume (DV)/fill volume (FV), or DV/FV, and clinical symptoms and signs associated with the overfill report. RESULTS: Among 462 MAUDE reports with a possible overfill event, 440 reports (95.2%) with a confirmed overfill event contained sufficient information to ascertain the clinical severity of the event. The number of reports with a clinical severity rating of minor, moderate, major, or death was 331, 71, 28, and 10, respectively. The median (range) DV/FV for a subgroup of 292 reports with a clinical severity rating of minor, moderate, major, or death was 1.63 (1.06 - 4.29), 1.71 (1.08 - 5.87), 2.14(1.64 - 2.61), and 2.50 (2.28 - 3.33), respectively. Insufficient drain accounted for a majority of overfill reports. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of reports from the MAUDE database suggests an association between DV/FV and clinical severity of the reported overfill event, as well as significant patient-to-patient variability with respect to intraperitoneal volume tolerance.",

    "Abstract": "The article entitled, Performance of the CONTOUR® TS Blood Glucose Monitoring System, by Frank and colleagues in this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, demonstrates that the CONTOUR® TS glucose meter exceeds current regulatory expectations for glucose meter performance. However, the appropriateness of current regulatory expectations, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15197:2003, is being reevaluated because of increasing concern regarding the reliability of glucose meters in ambulatory and hospitalized environments. Between 2004 and 2008, 12,673 serious adverse events with glucose meters that met the ISO 15197 expectations were reported in the Food and Drug Administration-Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience surveillance database. Should different glucose meter performance criteria be applied to ambulatory versus critical care patients?",

    "Abstract": "The Vena Tech LP vena cava filter (B Braun, Evanston, Illinois) has been FDA approved since 2001 and is a permanent vena cava filtration device. It replaced the previous Vena tech LGM filter also manufactured by B Braun. The LGM filter had 2 case series reporting a high incidence of incomplete deployment of the filter, especially when placed from a jugular approach. Design changes were made to this device and the LP filter introduced. The LP filter has also been reported to have incompletely deployed both in peer reviewed literature as well as the FDA MAUDE website. We present here 3 cases of incomplete deployment of the Vena Tech LP filter and review the cases previously described as well as attempt to present possible etiologies for incomplete deployment.",

    "Abstract": "The ASGE Technology Committee provides reviews of existing, new, or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, performing a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the Committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. When financial guidance is indicated, the most recent coding data and list prices at the time of publication are provided. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through September 2010 for articles related to endoscopy by using the key words \"gastroscope,\" \"colonoscope,\" \"echoendoscope,\" \"duodenoscope,\" \"choledochoscope,\" \"ultraslim endoscope,\" \"variable stiffness colonoscope,\" and \"wide-angle colonoscope.\" Technology Status Evaluation Reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Abstract": "The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) Technology Committee provides reviews of existing, new, or emerging endoscopic technologies that have an impact on the practice of GI endoscopy. Evidence-based methodology is used, with a MEDLINE literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies on the topic and a MAUDE (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health) database search to identify the reported complications of a given technology. Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. When financial guidance is indicated, the most recent coding data and list prices at the time of publication are provided. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through August 2010 for articles related to enteral, esophageal, duodenal, and colonic stents. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Technology Status Evaluation Reports are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review reported adverse events associated with suspected nickel hypersensitivity and subsequent clinical outcomes in patients with Essure implants and to evaluate the correlation of nickel allergy-related adverse events with positive results of nickel patch testing. DESIGN: Case series (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Reports of suspected nickel hypersensitivity reported from 2001 through July 21, 2010, were collected from de-identified data obtained from the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database and reports to the manufacturer directly from treating physicians, and published results for the 650 patients in the Phase II and Pivotal trials. Clinical outcomes and symptom resolution, when available, were obtained from de-identified information provided by the treating physicians to the manufacturer. Patients were not directly contacted for the study, and patient files were not reviewed. Patch testing was performed at the discretion of the treating physicians. Results were reported as positive or negative, without mention of the method or brand of patch testing used. CONCLUSION: Even considering the possibility of underreporting by several orders of magnitude, the reported incidence of adverse events suspected to be related to nickel hypersensitivity in patients with Essure micro-inserts is extremely small (0.01%). The incidence of confirmed nickel reactions is even smaller. This very low incidence of clinical reactions is consistent with data from other nickel-containing implantable devices and is reassuring, raising the question of whether nickel reactions are clinically relevant in the use of nitinol-containing micro-inserts for hysteroscopic sterilization.",

    "Title": "Analysis of automated external defibrillator device failures reported to the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: Automated external defibrillators are essential for treatment of cardiac arrest by lay rescuers and must determine when to shock and if they are functioning correctly. We seek to characterize automated external defibrillator failures reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and whether battery failures are properly detected by automated external defibrillators. METHODS: FDA adverse event reports are catalogued in the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We developed and internally validated an instrument for analyzing MAUDE data, reviewing all reports in which a fatality occurred. Two trained reviewers independently analyzed each report, and a third resolved discrepancies or passed them to a committee for resolution. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred eighty-four adverse events were reported between June 1993 and October 2008, of which 1,150 were failed defibrillation attempts. Thirty-seven automated external defibrillators never powered on, 252 failed to complete rhythm analysis, and 524 failed to deliver a recommended shock. In 149 cases, the operator disagreed with the device's rhythm analysis. In 54 cases, the defibrillator stated the batteries were low and in 110 other instances powered off unexpectedly. Interrater agreement between reviewers 1 and 2 ranged by question from 69.0% to 98.6% and for most likely cause was 55.9%. Agreement was obtained for 93.7% to 99.6% of questions by the third reviewer. Remaining discrepancies were resolved by the arbitration committee. CONCLUSION: MAUDE information is often incomplete and frequently no corroborating data are available. Some conditions not detected by automated external defibrillators during self-test cause units to power off unexpectedly, causing defibrillation delays. Backup units frequently provide shocks to patients.",

    "Title": "Using FDA reports to inform a classification for health information technology safety problems.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To expand an emerging classification for problems with health information technology (HIT) using reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: HIT events submitted to MAUDE were retrieved using a standardized search strategy. Using an emerging classification with 32 categories of HIT problems, a subset of relevant events were iteratively analyzed to identify new categories. Two coders then independently classified the remaining events into one or more categories. Free-text descriptions were analyzed to identify the consequences of events. MEASUREMENTS: Descriptive statistics by number of reported problems per category and by consequence; inter-rater reliability analysis using the κ statistic for the major categories and consequences. RESULTS: A search of 899 768 reports from January 2008 to July 2010 yielded 1100 reports about HIT. After removing duplicate and unrelated reports, 678 reports describing 436 events remained. The authors identified four new categories to describe problems with software functionality, system configuration, interface with devices, and network configuration; the authors' classification with 32 categories of HIT problems was expanded by the addition of these four categories. Examination of the 436 events revealed 712 problems, 96% were machine-related, and 4% were problems at the human-computer interface. Almost half (46%) of the events related to hazardous circumstances. Of the 46 events (11%) associated with patient harm, four deaths were linked to HIT problems (0.9% of 436 events). CONCLUSIONS: Only 0.1% of the MAUDE reports searched were related to HIT. Nevertheless, Food and Drug Administration reports did prove to be a useful new source of information about the nature of software problems and their safety implications with potential to inform strategies for safe design and implementation.",

    "Title": "Cardiac tamponade as a life-threatening complication in hernia repair.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The placement of mesh in the repair of all types of hernia has been reported to decrease recurrence rates. There are several well known complications related to mesh repairs, including infection, erosion, seroma, and pain. Lesser reported are cardiac injuries secondary to anchoring of the mesh to the diaphragm. METHODS: We report 2 previously unreported, unpublished cases of cardiac tamponade after mesh fixation to the diaphragm and present a review of the literature and search of the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: We reviewed a total of 10 cases of cardiac tamponade in hiatal hernia repair, 6 resulting in patient mortality, 5 cases in ventral hernia repair, 4 being fatal. Ten cases were caused by the helical tacker, 2 by sutures, 1 by the straight stapler, and in 1 case the cause was not identified. CONCLUSION: When anchoring mesh to the diaphragm, it is necessary to consider the risk of injury to the heart and cardiac tamponade, especially if the helical tacker is used in this region. Only with appropriate awareness and recognition can this catastrophic complication be avoided.",

    "Title": "Incidence and avoidance of neurologic complications with paddle type spinal cord stimulation leads.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While reference is frequently made to the risk of spinal cord or nerve root injury with the surgical implantation of paddle type spinal cord stimulation (SCS) electrodes, data are lacking on the frequency, causes, and prevention of these complications. METHODS: To determine the incidence and frequency of neurologic complications, we performed 1) a comprehensive analysis of the literature to determine the incidence of complications that have caused or could lead to neurologic injury; 2) an analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data base; and 3) an investigation of manufacturers' data on surgically implanted paddle electrodes. We then convened an expert panel of neurosurgeons experienced in the surgical implantation of paddle electrodes to provide recommendations to minimize the risk of neurologic injury. RESULTS: The scientific literature describes the breadth of neurologic complications that can result from SCS electrode implantation but does not provide interpretable data with respect to the incidence and frequency of these complications. The MAUDE data base is not constructed to be sensitive or specific enough to provide these critical data. Primary data show a risk of neurologic injury from implantation of paddle electrodes below 0.6%. DISCUSSION: Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures to further minimize this risk are described. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation, the first comprehensive evaluation of the incidence and frequency of neurologic injury as a result of SCS paddle electrode implantation, suggests that neurologic injury is a rare, but serious, complication of SCS. The incidence of these complications should be decreased by the adoption of approaches that improve procedural safety and by careful patient follow-up and complication management. Physicians should be aware of these approaches and take every precaution to reduce the risk of neurologic injury. Physicians also should report any adverse event leading to injury or death and work together to improve access to these data.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To review the available literature on retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters to examine the effectiveness and risks of these devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Investigators searched MEDLINE for clinical trials evaluating retrievable filters and reviewed the complications reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). RESULTS: Eligibility criteria were met by 37 studies comprising 6,834 patients. All of the trials had limitations, and no studies were randomized. There were 11 prospective clinical trials; the rest were retrospective studies. Despite the limitations of the evidence, the IVC filters seemed to be effective in preventing pulmonary embolism (PE); the rate of PE after IVC placement was 1.7%. The mean retrieval rate was 34%. Most of the filters became permanent devices. Multiple complications associated with the use of IVC filters were described in the reviewed literature or were reported to the MAUDE database; most of these were associated with long-term use (> 30 days). At the present time, the objective comparison data of different filter designs do not support superiority of any particular design. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk patients for whom anticoagulation is not feasible, retrievable IVC filters seem to be effective in preventing PE. Long-term complications are a serious concern with the use of these filters. The evidence of the effectiveness and the risks was limited by the small number of prospective studies.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess annual rates of robotic system malfunctions and compare the da Vinci S(®) system (dVS) and da Vinci(®) surgical system (dV). To assess the types of malfunctions and associated outcomes for robotic cases and determine the extent to which experience and technological improvements impact these. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database, a publicly available, voluntary reporting system (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm). The database was searched using the two phrases 'da Vinci' and 'Intuitive Surgical' from 2003 to 2009. Malfunctions of the instruments, console, patient-side cart, camera and cannula were recorded. Data on intraoperative injuries, case delays and conversions were also collected. RESULTS: In all, 1914 reports were reviewed (991 dVS and 878 dV, 45 unclassified) with peak years for reports of 2008 for dVS (571) and 2007 for dV (211), P < 0.001. With respect to time, the proportion of console and patient-side cart malfunctions declined from 2007 onward compared with the proportions prior to 2007 (5.1% vs 9.4% and 6.6% vs 10.9%). Patient injury did not change with year of surgery (0.5-5.4% of malfunctions, P= 0.358), open conversions declined (21.3% of malfunctions before 2007 vs 9.9% from 2007 onward, P < 0.001) and patient deaths increased (0.0013% of cases before 2007 vs 0.0061% of cases from 2007 onward, P < 0.001). With regard to robotic system, console and patient-side cart malfunctions were more frequent with the dV than the dVS: 82/878 vs 39/991 and 100/878 vs 48/991, P < 0.001. Open conversion was more frequent with dV than dVS (19.3% vs 7.7% of reported malfunctions, P < 0.001), while patient injury was less with dV than dVS (3.5% vs 5.9%, P= 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The dVS decreased console and patient-side cart errors relative to total malfunctions, which were also influenced by surgical year. Open conversions were reduced by increased robotic experience and newer surgical system. Differences in patient injury may reflect changes in reporting or case complexity.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of lead fracture and inappropriate shock events related to Sprint Fidelis leads in January 2007. The manufacturer announced a voluntary market withdrawal in October 2007. AIM: Our aim was to retrospectively evaluate this safety signal using disproportionality analysis to estimate whether disproportionality analysis could have detected this particular safety signal earlier than actually occurred. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database contains reports on device-related adverse events, of which, FDA receives several hundred thousand every year. For each manufacturer, a list of the top lead brand names was ranked by frequency of reports. We used the Multi-item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS) method for analysis. We isolated 11 top-reported implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) lead brand names. Using MGPS methodology, we calculated the one-sided 95% lower confidence bound EB05 on the empirical Bayes geometric mean of the reporting ratio. RESULTS: We performed individual MGPS analysis for each of the top reported adverse events in 2006 for ICD leads. Fidelis had the highest EB05 scores for lead fractures and inappropriate shock. DISCUSSION: Through disproportionality analysis of the MAUDE database, we were able to identify known safety signals associated with the Medtronic Sprint Fidelis lead. CONCLUSION: If utilized at the time, this disproportionality analysis would have identified signals earlier for lead fractures, oversensing, high impedance, and inappropriate shock.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There have been 283 cases of meningitis after cochlear implantation reported since 2002 to the CDC Database Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, resulting in 30 fatalities. This is the latest of a number of reports to track the continuing problem of meningitis occurring in cochlear implant users, mainly children. RESULTS: Although a number of these patients had received a device with a 2-piece electrode, the withdrawal of that particular device has not prevented further cases from occurring. There are many potential etiologic factors potentially involved in postimplantation bacterial meningitis; although some can be managed or eliminated, vaccination against the most prevalent causal organism, the streptococcus pneumoniae, seems to be a powerful tool against this uncommon but serious complication of cochlear implantation. CONCLUSION: Although up to 20 new cases of post-cochlear implantation meningitis continue to occur annually worldwide, considering the number of new devices implanted each year, it is expected that the incidence of this complication seems to be diminishing.",

    "Title": "Adverse events reported after the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The US Food and Drug Administration has approved recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) (Infuse Bone Graft; Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Minneapolis, MN) as an alternative to autogenous bone graft for sinus augmentations and for localized alveolar ridge augmentations for defects associated with extraction sockets. The objective of this analysis was to characterize adverse events reported after the use of rhBMP-2 in oral and maxillofacial procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database contains reports of adverse events involving medical devices. The publicly available version of the database was searched for reports for the brand name Infuse Bone Graft. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the procedures and adverse events. RESULTS: As of April 30, 2011, the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database contained 83 reports of adverse events after oral and maxillofacial operations involving rhBMP-2. Of these reports, 55 (66.3%) described off-label uses, such as reconstruction of the mandible after fracture or cancer or alveolar cleft repair. The most commonly reported adverse events included local reactions, graft failure, infections, and other wound complications. Of the reports, 25 (30.1%) stated that the patient required additional surgery to address the reported adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Serious adverse events, some of which may require a second operation, can occur after the use of rhBMP-2 in oral and maxillofacial procedures. In this analysis graft, failure and pseudarthrosis were more commonly reported after off-label uses of rhBMP-2 than approved uses.",

We examined the problems in 46 relevant events submitted to MAUDE from January 2008 to July 2010 to identify natural categories of problems from a clinical perspective. CPOE and PACS were involved in 93% of the events. Adverse events were associated with medications in 41%, clinical processes in 33%, radiation in 15% and surgery in 11%. There were four deaths. Strategies to improve the safety of HIT should focus on designing safe user interfaces, integrated checks of key identifiers and decision support, and engineering safer clinical processes.",

In this paper, the CNTRO reasoning framework is applied to temporal analysis of medical device adverse event files. One specific adverse event was used as a test case: late stent thrombosis. Adverse event narratives were obtained from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturing and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database2. 15 adverse event files in which late stent thrombosis was confirmed were randomly selected across multiple drug eluting stent devices. From these files, 81 events and 72 temporal relations were annotated. 73 temporal questions were generated, of which 65 were correctly answered by the CNTRO system. This results in an overall accuracy of 89%. This system should be pursued further to continue assessing its potential benefits in temporal analysis of medical device adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Longitudinal stent deformation (LSD) is a recently described complication of PCI, but mechanisms contributing to its occurrence and associated clinical outcomes remain unclear. The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched to identify cases of LSD to gain insight into procedural and anatomical factors that predispose to this complication and associated clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MAUDE database is a voluntary international electronic reporting system whose aim is to capture major adverse events involving medical devices. Using defined search terms, we identified 57 unique cases of LSD ranging from 2004-2011. A significant increase in the reporting of LSD in the last two years was observed with most reported cases in stents based on the Element platform (90%). The lesions in which LSD was reported were complex (vessel calcification 26%; tortuosity 25%; long 28%; ostial disease 21%) and most frequently occurred following attempts to pass or withdraw secondary devices through a previously deployed stent (89% cases where mechanism identified). Adverse clinical outcomes including emergent cardiac surgery and acute and sub-acute stent thrombosis occurred in eight cases. CONCLUSIONS: LSD can occur secondary to a variety of mechanisms; identification and treatment is important since adverse incidents such as emergent CABG and stent thrombosis may occur. A novel classification system is proposed to facilitate future reporting of this complication.",

Both are supplemented by accessing the \"related articles\" feature of PubMed and by scrutinizing pertinent references cited by the identified studies. Controlled clinical trials are emphasized, but in many cases, data from randomized, controlled trials are lacking. In such cases, large case series, preliminary clinical studies, and expert opinions are used. Technical data are gathered from traditional and Web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. For this review, the MEDLINE database was searched through January 2011 using the keywords \"bariatric,\" \"endoscopic,\" \"intragastric balloon,\" \"duodenojejunal bypass sleeve,\" and \"transoral gastroplasty.\" Reports on Emerging Technologies are drafted by 1 or 2 members of the ASGE Technology Committee, reviewed and edited by the committee as a whole, and approved by the Governing Board of the ASGE. These reports are scientific reviews provided solely for educational and informational purposes. Reports on Emerging Technologies are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment or payment for such treatment.",

    "Title": "The unacknowledged incidence of laparoscopic stapler malfunction.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic instruments are being used with increasing frequency. Our surgeons recently experienced several independent adverse events involving the laparoscopic linear stapler. Although the Food and Drug Administration maintains a Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to track such voluntary reports, many events are not reported and the true incidence of adverse events is unknown. We attempted to determine how frequently minimally invasive surgeons have experienced technical problems with a laparoscopic stapler. METHODS: Following IRB approval, we electronically distributed an anonymous 10-question survey to the 124 minimally invasive program directors listed in the Fellowship Council database. The questions focused on personal or peer experience with laparoscopic stapler malfunction, frequency and type of malfunction, device manufacturer, whether the operation was altered, and root cause analysis of the event. RESULTS: Forty-four of the 124 program directors (35%) completed the survey. The majority reported personal or peer experience (86%) with a linear stapler not releasing (66%) or not firing (73%) after application, with 27% of the respondents noting that this occurred three or more times. The malfunction was not related to type of load, straight (23%) or reticulating (32%) model, or manufacturer (Ethicon 30%, Covidien 36%). One quarter of the respondents noted that the malfunction caused them to significantly alter their operative procedure, and 30% reported that they received no helpful feedback from the manufacturer despite contacting it. CONCLUSIONS: Most minimally invasive surgeons have experienced laparoscopic linear stapler malfunction and 25% have had to significantly alter the planned operative procedure due to the malfunction.",

    "Abstract": "AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine if Optim™, a unique copolymer of silicone and polyurethane, protects Riata ST Optim and Durata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads (SJM, St Jude Medical Inc., Sylmar, CA, USA) from abrasions that cause lead failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturers and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database on 13 April 2012 using the simple search terms 'Riata ST Optim™ abrasion analysis' and 'Durata abrasion analysis'. Lead implant time was estimated by subtracting 3 months from the reported lead age. The MAUDE search returned 15 reports for Riata ST Optim™ and 37 reports for Durata leads, which were submitted by SJM based on its analyses of returned leads for clinical events that occurred between December 2007 and January 2012. Riata ST Optim™ leads had been implanted 29.1 ± 11.7 months. Eight of 15 leads had can abrasions and three abrasions were caused by friction with another device, most likely another lead. Four of these abrasions resulted in high-voltage failures and one death. One failure was caused by an internal insulation defect. Durata leads had been implanted 22.2 ± 10.6 months. Twelve Durata leads had can abrasions, and six leads had abrasions caused by friction with another device. Of these 18 can and other device abrasions, 13 (72%) had electrical abnormalities. Low impedances identified three internal insulation abrasions. CONCLUSIONS: Riata ST Optim™ and Durata ICD leads have failed due to insulation abrasions. Optim™ did not prevent these abrasions, which developed ≤ 4 years after implant. Studies are needed to determine the incidence of these failures and their clinical implications.",

    "Title": "Mesh complications in female pelvic floor reconstructive surgery and their management: A systematic review.",
    "Abstract": "We reviewed the incidence, predisposing factors, presentation and management of complications related to the use of synthetic mesh in the management of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse repair. Immediate complications, such as bleeding, hematoma, injury to adjacent organs during placement of mesh and complication of voiding dysfunction are not discussed in this review, since they are primarily related to technique. A PubMed search of related articles published in English was done from April 2008 to March 2011. Key words used were urinary incontinence, mesh, complications, midurethral sling, anterior prolapse, anterior vaginal repair, pelvic organ prolapse, transvaginal mesh, vault prolapse, midurethral slings, female stress urinary incontinence, mesh erosion, vaginal mesh complications, and posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Since there were very few articles dealing with the management of mesh-related complications in the period covered in the search we extended the search from January 2005 onwards. Articles were selected to fit the scope of the topic. In addition, landmark publications and Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data (FDA website) were included on the present topic. A total of 170 articles were identified. The use of synthetic mesh in sub-urethral sling procedures is now considered the standard for the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence. Synthetic mesh is being increasingly used in the management of pelvic organ prolapse. While the incidence of extrusion and erosion with mid-urethral sling is low, the extrusion rate in prolapse repair is somewhat higher and the use in posterior compartment remains controversial. When used through the abdominal approach the extrusion and erosion rates are lower. The management of mesh complication is an individualized approach. The choice of the technique should be based on the type of mesh complication, location of the extrusion and/or erosion, its magnitude, severity and potential recurrence of pelvic floor defect.",

    "Title": "Minimally invasive endometrial ablation device complications and use outside of the manufacturers' instructions.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for reports describing serious adverse events and adverse events reports describing use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions for the five FDA-approved minimally invasive endometrial ablation devices. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for reports of device malfunction, patient injury, or death reported for each device from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2011. We reviewed U.S. reports individually for annotations of patient injury or death and tabulated the reports by type of injury and device. We identified nine categories of serious injury (death, sepsis or bacteremia, intra-abdominal abscess, uterine rupture, thermal bowel injury, mechanical bowel injury, transmural uterine thermal injury, urologic injury, and lower genital tract or skin burns) and noted all reports citing device use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions. We also identified reports of hysterectomy or bowel resection attributable to an adverse event. RESULTS: Serious adverse events, including bowel injury (n=128), sepsis or bacteremia (n=47), intra-abdominal abscess (n=18), urologic injury (n=2), and uterine rupture (n=1) were reported. Death was also reported (n=4). Eight percent (66 of 829) of serious adverse events reports cited use outside of the manufacturers' labeled instructions, as did 7.3% (6 of 82) of reports citing need for hysterectomy and 8.7% (9 of 103) of reports of bowel resection. CONCLUSION: The findings from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database highlight the potential risk of serious complications related to endometrial ablation and underscore the importance of training in correct device use and familiarity with the manufacturer's labeled instructions.

    "Title": "Pediatric use of insulin pump technology: a retrospective study of adverse events in children ages 1-12 years.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growing technological improvements in insulin pump design have increased the use of these devices in young children. To better understand the types of infusion pump-related problems and associated adverse events in this age group, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of pump-related adverse event reports received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children ages 1-12 years. METHODS: A query was conducted of FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2009, in children ages 1-12 years involving insulin pumps. Report narratives were individually reviewed for age, gender, and seriousness of outcomes. Device or patient problems and potential contributory factors were assessed. RESULTS: Over the past 14 years, 1774 (7%) of all insulin pump adverse event reports were identified in children ages 1-12. Of these reports, 777 (43%) resulted in hospitalization. In hospitalized cases (n = 614), diabetic ketoacidosis and/or hyperglycemia were the predominant patient problems, and in other cases (n = 98), hypoglycemia was evident. There were 106 emergency room visits, 19 cases requiring paramedic attention, and five deaths. The majority of reports indicated that the devices were not returned to the manufacturer, and root causes were not always confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Younger children with diabetes deserve careful consideration of the risk and benefit of insulin pump technology. Studies are needed to better understand pediatric safety issues and to identify the root cause of adverse events. Problems related to patient education, device misuse, and malfunctions were found, highlighting the need to strengthen user training for children and their caregivers.",

    "Title": "Multiple intravenous infusions phase 1b: practice and training scan.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Minimal research has been conducted into the potential patient safety issues related to administering multiple intravenous (IV) infusions to a single patient. Previous research has highlighted that there are a number of related safety risks. In Phase 1a of this study, an analysis of 2 national incident-reporting databases (Institute for Safe Medical Practices Canada and United States Food and Drug Administration MAUDE) found that a high percentage of incidents associated with the administration of multiple IV infusions resulted in patient harm. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of Phase 1b of this study were to identify safety issues with the potential to cause patient harm stemming from the administration of multiple IV infusions; and to identify how nurses are being educated on key principles required to safely administer multiple IV infusions. DATA SOURCES AND REVIEW METHODS: A field study was conducted at 12 hospital clinical units (sites) across Ontario, and telephone interviews were conducted with program coordinators or instructors from both the Ontario baccalaureate nursing degree programs and the Ontario postgraduate Critical Care Nursing Certificate programs. Data were analyzed using Rasmussen's 1997 Risk Management Framework and a Health Care Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two primary patient safety issues were identified with the potential to directly cause patient harm. Seventeen of these (critical issues) were categorized into 6 themes. A cause-consequence tree was established to outline all possible contributing factors for each critical issue. Clinical recommendations were identified for immediate distribution to, and implementation by, Ontario hospitals. Future investigation efforts were planned for Phase 2 of the study. LIMITATIONS: This exploratory field study identifies the potential for errors, but does not describe the direct observation of such errors, except in a few cases where errors were observed. Not all issues are known in advance, and the frequency of errors is too low to be observed in the time allotted and with the limited sample of observations. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of multiple IV infusions to a single patient is a complex task with many potential associated patient safety risks. Improvements to infusion and infusion-related technology, education standards, clinical best practice guidelines, hospital policies, and unit work practices are required to reduce the risk potential. This report makes several recommendations to Ontario hospitals so that they can develop an awareness of the issues highlighted in this report and minimize some of the risks. Further investigation of mitigating strategies is required and will be undertaken in Phase 2 of this research.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Adverse effects of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in spinal surgery have previously been observed. However, because of its size, scope, and nature, the US Food and Drug Administration's database of postmarketing reports is useful for detecting new and unexpected safety concerns. PURPOSE: To characterize adverse events reported to the FDA; to characterize off-label use of rhBMP-2. STUDY DESIGN: Review of adverse events reported to the FDA after the use of rhBMP-2 (INFUSE Bone Graft) in spinal surgery. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched for the brand name \"infuse bone graft,\" for reports received from July 2, 2002, through August 31, 2011. Adverse events were reviewed, summarized, and classified by an MD. For each report, the most important clinical entity was identified as the principal adverse event. Off-label uses were summarized. RESULTS: Of 834 reports, four (0.5%) described procedures in which rhBMP-2 was used in accordance with the approved indication. Nearly half of all the reports, 370 (44.4%), stated that the patient required revision surgery or other invasive interventions to address the reported adverse event. Swelling, fluid collections, osteolysis, pain/radiculopathy, heterotopic bone, pseudarthrosis, surgical site infections and other wound complications, thromboembolic events, respiratory distress, cancer, and other events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Because of their duration, scope, and expense, prospective studies designed to estimate the risk of rare adverse events may be impractical. Despite its imperfections, postmarketing surveillance helps to narrow the focus by revealing patterns and prioritizing topics for further research. One should not extrapolate from these results to the rhBMP-2 experience as a whole; the findings reported here might not be representative. This analysis indicates that serious adverse events can occur after the use of rhBMP-2 in spinal surgery and raises many points that surgeons may wish to consider when deciding when and how to use this product in their patients.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The FDA has approved recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) for treating acute, open tibial shaft fractures. However, the nature and frequency of complications after the use of rhBMP-2 in nonspinal orthopaedic surgery have not been well characterized. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To determine what types of adverse events have been reported after the use of rhBMP-2, whether they were severe enough to require additional surgery, and after what types of operations these adverse events occurred. METHODS: Adverse events reported to the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: Through December 31, 2011, the FDA has received 62 reports of adverse events involving rhBMP-2 in nonspinal orthopaedic procedures. Surgical site infections and other wound complications, heterotopic bone, pseudarthrosis, and local inflammation were among the most commonly reported adverse events. Almost half of the reports (30 reports; 48%) stated that the patients required secondary interventions to address the reported adverse events. The majority (49 reports; 79%) described adverse events occurring after unapproved uses, such as management of tibial plateau fractures, treatment of congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia, and humeral reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Serious adverse events can occur after the use of rhBMP-2 in nonspinal orthopaedic procedures and may necessitate additional surgery. Most events in this analysis occurred after off-label uses. Postmarketing review of adverse event reports remains an important approach for identifying potential safety concerns.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our goal was to analyze reported instances of the da Vinci robotic surgical system instrument failures using the FDA's MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database. From these data we identified some root causes of failures as well as trends that may assist surgeons and users of the robotic technology. METHODS: We conducted a survey of the MAUDE database and tallied robotic instrument failures that occurred between January 2009 and December 2010. We categorized failures into five main groups (cautery, shaft, wrist or tool tip, cable, and control housing) based on technical differences in instrument design and function. RESULTS: A total of 565 instrument failures were documented through 528 reports. The majority of failures (285) were of the instrument's wrist or tool tip. Cautery problems comprised 174 failures, 76 were shaft failures, 29 were cable failures, and 7 were control housing failures. Of the reports, 10 had no discernible failure mode and 49 exhibited multiple failures. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that a number of robotic instrument failures occurred in a short period of time. In reality, many instrument failures may go unreported, thus a true failure rate cannot be determined from these data. However, education of hospital administrators, operating room staff, surgeons, and patients should be incorporated into discussions regarding the introduction and utilization of robotic technology. We recommend institutions incorporate standard failure reporting policies so that the community of robotic surgery companies and surgeons can improve on existing technologies for optimal patient safety and outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review worldwide data on cochlear implant adverse events, test for significant trends over a 10-year period and discuss possible reasons behind such trends. To evaluate the suitability of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for analysis of trends in cochlear implant adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of cochlear implant adverse events reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as recorded on the MAUDE database. Data for each adverse event reported in the years 2000 (n = 237), 2005 (n = 1089), and 2010 (n = 2543) were evaluated and assigned to one of 14 categories according to report content. Incidence data were compared across the 3 sampling points to determine trends. HYPOTHESIS: Improvements in cochlear implant manufacturing processes and surgical techniques would result in a decrease in the proportion of CI adverse events because of primary device failure or surgical factors, relative to those with complex, multi-factorial or idiopathic origins, over the 10 year sampling period. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Statistical analyses showed a significant increase over time in the proportion of CI adverse events that had multiple or unknown causes, particularly cases of gradual idiopathic loss of performance, as compared with those with a clearly defined underlying device-related or medical cause. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that there is an urgent need to undertake further research to investigate causes for idiopathic and gradual CI adverse events to continue the overall improvement in CI outcomes.",

Had the accuracy of these devices been periodically assessed pre-operatively, many of them might have been prevented. The technical accuracy of a commercial navigator enabling the use of both optical (OTS) and electromagnetic (EMTS) tracking systems was assessed in the hospital setting using accuracy assessment tools and methods developed by the authors of this paper. The technical accuracy was obtained by comparing the positions of the navigated tool tip with the phantom accuracy assessment points. Each assessment contained a total of 51 points and a region of surgical interest (ROSI) volume of 120x120x100 mm roughly mimicking the size of the human head. The error analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the trend of accuracy of the surgical navigator modalities. This study showed that the technical accuracies of OTS and EMTS over the pre-determined ROSI were nearly equal. However, the placement of the particular modality hardware needs to be optimized for the surgical procedure. New applications of EMTS, which does not require rigid immobilization of the surgical area, are suggested.",

    "Title": "Using statistical text classification to identify health information technology incidents.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using statistical text classification to automatically identify health information technology (HIT) incidents in the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: We used a subset of 570 272 incidents including 1534 HIT incidents reported to MAUDE between 1 January 2008 and 1 July 2010. Text classifiers using regularized logistic regression were evaluated with both 'balanced' (50% HIT) and 'stratified' (0.297% HIT) datasets for training, validation, and testing. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, feature selection, cross-validation, classification, performance evaluation, and error analysis were performed iteratively to further improve the classifiers. Feature-selection techniques such as removing short words and stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and principal component analysis were examined. MEASUREMENTS: κ statistic, F1 score, precision and recall. RESULTS: Classification performance was similar on both the stratified (0.954 F1 score) and balanced (0.995 F1 score) datasets. Stemming was the most effective technique, reducing the feature set size to 79% while maintaining comparable performance. Training with balanced datasets improved recall (0.989) but reduced precision (0.165). CONCLUSIONS: Statistical text classification appears to be a feasible method for identifying HIT reports within large databases of incidents. Automated identification should enable more HIT problems to be detected, analyzed, and addressed in a timely manner. Semi-supervised learning may be necessary when applying machine learning to big data analysis of patient safety incidents and requires further investigation.",

    "Title": "Reporting the impact of inferior vena cava perforation by filters.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perforation of the inferior vena cava by filters struts is a known complication. The goal of our review is to assess the impact of inferior vena cava perforation by filters based on an open, voluntary national database. METHODS: We reviewed 3311 adverse events of inferior vena cava filters reported in Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 2000 to June 2011. Outcomes of interest were incidence of inferior vena cava perforation, type of filter, clinical presentation, and management of the perforation, including retrievability rates. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-one (12%) cases of inferior vena cava perforation were reported. The annual distribution of inferior vena cava perforation was 35 cases (9%), varying from seven (2%) to 70 (18%). A three-fold increment in the number of adverse events related to inferior vena cava filters has been noted since 2004. Wall perforation as an incidental finding was the most common presentation (N = 268, 69%). Surrounding organ involvement was found in 117 cases (30%), with the aorta being the most common in 43 cases (37%), followed by small bowel in 36 (31%). Filters were retrieved in 97 patients (83%) regardless of wall perforation. Twenty-five (26%) cases required an open procedure to remove the filter. Neither major bleeding requiring further intervention nor mortality was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Inferior vena cava perforation by filters remains stable over the studied years despite increasing numbers of adverse events reported. The majority of filters involved in a perforation were retrievable. Filter retrieval, regardless of inferior vena cava wall perforation, is feasible and must be attempted whenever possible in order to avoid complications.",

    "Title": "Distribution of reported StarClose SE vascular closure device complications in the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the type and frequency of complications associated with the StarClose SE vascular closure device reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for comparison with complications reported in clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complications reported in the MAUDE database related to use of the StarClose SE vascular closure device were reviewed. Keyword searches by device and manufacturer were performed for a 16-month period from July 2009-October 2010. Reports were analyzed according to complication type, frequency, and resolution, if specified. These data were compared with data on StarClose SE device complications, which included three prospective randomized trials and five prospective nonrandomized trials. RESULTS: Keyword searches returned 1,107 total records and 1,118 categorizable StarClose SE device complications from the 16-month MAUDE database-reporting period. Complications in order of frequency (absolute number and relative frequency, respectively) included failure to achieve hemostasis (409, 36.6%), inability to complete the deployment sequence (268, 24.0%), entrapped deployment device (224, 20%), clip not deployed (151,13.5%), late bleeding or oozing from dermatotomy site (25, 2.2%), vessel occlusion (19, 1.7%), retroperitoneal hematoma (12, 1.1%), pseudoaneurysm formation (6, 0.5%) and death (4, 0.4%). The distribution of complications differed appreciably from the combined adverse events compiled from the published trials evaluating the StarClose SE device. There were no records describing inability to remove the deployment device in the published trials, whereas this represented the third most common complication reported to the MAUDE database. Bleeding or oozing from the dermatotomy site, the most frequent relative complication reported in the published literature (53.4%), represented 2.2% of the total complications reported to the MAUDE database. CONCLUSIONS: The type and frequency of complications reported in the MAUDE database on the StarClose SE vascular closure device differ from those published in clinical trials both in relative distribution and in type. Although these differences may reflect in part reporting biases, the distribution of complications reported to the MAUDE database may represent useful information in the use of this device.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conductor fractures may affect the performance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads. During routine surveillance of returned product analyses (RPAs) in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database, we found a number of conductor fractures in small diameter implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads manufactured by St Jude Medical, Inc (SJM, Sylmar, CA). OBJECTIVES: To determine the location and cause of these fractures and to catalog their clinical signs and consequences. METHODS: We searched the FDA's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database on April 11, 2013. SJM provided information and data it collected independently. RESULTS: Our search found 59 leads with fractures in the IS-1 leg. Most fractures were in leads implanted in 2008-2009; no fractures were found in leads implanted after 2010. Outer coil conductor fractures accounted for the majority (51 of 59, 86%). Oversensing and noise were common signs, and 81% of the patients received inappropriate shocks. SJM's RPAs found that the fractures were due to inadequate strain relief and redesigned the IS-1 leg by shortening the crimp bore. Younger age and subpectoral implants appeared to be associated with these fractures. SJM stated the incidence is low (0.040%) and has not seen further fractures of this type in leads with the modified crimp. CONCLUSIONS: SJM's small diameter leads that were manufactured before 2011 are prone to early outer coil fatigue fractures in the IS-1 leg. The failure mechanism appears to have been mitigated by a design change. RPA is important for improving device safety.",

    "Abstract": "Synthetic transvaginal mesh has been employed in the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse for more than a decade. As the use of these devices increased during this period so did adverse event reporting. In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Public Health Notification informed physicians and patients of rising concerns with the use of synthetic transvaginal mesh. Shortly thereafter and in parallel to marked increases in adverse event reporting within the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE), the FDA released a Safety Communication regarding urogynecologic surgical mesh use. Following this report and in the wake of increased medical industry product withdrawal, growing medicolegal concerns, patient safety, and clinical practice controversy, many gynecologists and pelvic reconstructive surgeons are left with limited long-term data, clinical guidance, and growing uncertainty regarding the role of synthetic transvaginal mesh use in pelvic organ prolapse. This paper reviews the reported complications of synthetic transvaginal mesh with an evidence-based approach as well as providing suggested guidance for the future role of its use amidst the controversy.",

    "Title": "Adverse events resulting from lasers used in urology.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To collate world reports of adverse events (AEs) resulting from lasers used in urology. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was searched using the term \"Laser for gastro-urology use.\" In addition, the Rockwell Laser Industries (RLI) Laser Accident Database was searched for the following types of lasers: neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), holmium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Ho:YAG), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), diode and thulium:YAG (Tm:YAG). RESULTS: Both databases were last accessed on October 1, 2012. Overall, there were 433 AEs; 166 in MAUDE database (1992-2012) and 267 in RLI database (1964-2005). Most of the AEs (198/433 or 46%) resulted from generator failure or fiber tip breaking. Whereas there were 20 (4.6%) AEs harming medical operators, there were 159 (37%) AEs harming nonmedical operators using Nd:YAG, KTP, and diode lasers. Eye injuries ranging from mild corneal abrasions to total vision loss were reported in 164 AEs with the use of Nd:YAG, KTP, and diode lasers. Overall, there were 36 (8.3%) AEs resulting in patient harm, including 7 (1.6%) mortalities, 3 deaths from ureteral perforation using the Ho:YAG laser, and 4 deaths from air emboli using the Nd:YAG laser. Other reported patient injuries included bladder perforation resulting in urinary diversion in a patient, in addition to minor skin burns, internal burns, and bleeding in others. There were no AEs reported with the use of Tm:YAG laser. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the AEs reported relate to equipment failure. There were no eye injuries reported with the use of Ho:YAG lasers. Caution must be exercised when using lasers in urology, including wearing appropriate eye protection when using Nd:YAG, KTP, and diode lasers.",

    "Title": "Hysteroscopic sterilization: 10-year retrospective analysis of worldwide pregnancy reports.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that might contribute to pregnancies reported after hysteroscopic sterilization worldwide. DESIGN: Retrospective review of commercial data compiled from the MAUDE database, medical literature, and manufacturer reports received during commercial distribution of hysteroscopic sterilization micro-inserts from 2001 through 2010 (Canadian Taskforce classification III descriptive study). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From 2001 through 2010, 497 305 hysteroscopic sterilization kits were distributed worldwide, and 748 pregnancies were reported, i.e., 0.15% of the estimated user population based on the number of distributed kits. The data were sufficient to enable analysis of 508 pregnancies for potential contributing factors and showed most to be associated with patient or physician noncompliance (n = 264) or misinterpreted confirmation tests (n = 212). Conceptions deemed to have occurred within 2 weeks of the procedure and therefore too early for detection were identified in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Although there are limitations to the dataset and the study design is retrospective, it represents the largest body of cumulative hysteroscopic sterilization data available to date. Of the 748 pregnancies reported, it is apparent that some might have been prevented with greater patient and clinician attention to interim contraceptive use and counseling and with more rigorous evaluation and informed interpretation of the procedure confirmation tests. Although the estimated pregnancy rate based on such a dataset is likely an underestimation, it does suggest that the evaluable field performance of hysteroscopic sterilization micro-inserts is consistent with the labeled age-adjusted effectiveness of 99.74% at 5 years.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database may be useful for clinicians using a Food and Drug Administration-approved medical device to identify the occurrence of adverse events and complications. We sought to analyze and investigate reports associated with the Essure hysteroscopic sterilization system (Conceptus Inc., Mountain View, CA) using this database. DESIGN: Retrospective review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for events related to Essure hysteroscopic sterilization from November 2002 to February 2012 (Canadian Task Force Classification III). SETTING: Online retrospective review. PATIENTS: Online reports of patients who underwent Essure tubal sterilization. INTERVENTION: Essure tubal sterilization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-seven adverse events were reported in the study period. Pain was the most frequently reported event (217 events [47.5%]) followed by delivery catheter malfunction (121 events [26.4%]). Poststerilization pregnancy was reported in 61 events (13.3%), of which 29 were ectopic pregnancies. Other reported events included perforation (90 events [19.7%]), abnormal bleeding (44 events [9.6%]), and microinsert malposition (33 events [7.2%]). The evaluation and management of these events resulted in an additional surgical procedure in 270 cases (59.1%), of which 44 were hysterectomies. CONCLUSION: Sixty-one unintended poststerilization pregnancies were reported in the study period, of which 29 (47.5%) were ectopic gestations. Thus, ectopic pregnancy must be considered if a woman becomes pregnant after Essure hysteroscopic sterilization. Additionally, 44 women underwent hysterectomy after an adverse event reported to be associated with the use of the device.",

    "Title": "Auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness of the potential hazard of auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series and summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of voluntary adverse event reports pertaining to microscope related auricular thermal injuries. PATIENTS AND SETTING: All patients who sustained auricular burns while using the operating microscope during otologic surgery at 2 tertiary academic referral centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical procedure, microscope model, intensity of illumination, length of procedure, focal length, location and severity of burn, and patient outcome. RESULTS: A total of 4 microscope-related auricular thermal injuries were identified from the authors' institutions. Additionally, 82 unique cases of soft tissue burns associated with the use of an operative microscope have been voluntarily reported to the FDA since 2004. A disproportionately large percent (∼ 30%) of these occurred within the field of otology, the majority of which were during tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy procedures at focal length distances of 300 mm or less with xenon light source microscopes. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous advancements in light delivery technologies and lens optics have continued to improve the efficiency of the operating microscope; however, these improvements also increase the potential for thermal injuries. Although rare, a review of the FDA MAUDE database suggests that microscope-related soft tissue burns occur more frequently in otology than any other surgical specialty. A variety of factors may help explain this finding, including the unique anatomy of the external ear with thin skin and limited underlying adipose tissue. Preventative measures should be taken to decrease the risk of thermal injuries including use of the lowest comfortable light intensity, adjusting the aperture width to match the operative field, frequent wound irrigation, and covering exposed portions of the pinna with a moist surgical sponge.",

    "Title": "Laparoscopic morcellator-related complications.",
    "Abstract": "Morcellation at laparoscopy is a commonly used minimally invasive method to extract bulky tissue from the abdomen without extending abdominal incisions. Despite widespread use of morcellation, complications still remain underreported and poorly understood. We performed a systematic review of surgical centers in the United States to identify, collate and update the morcellator-related injuries and near misses associated with powered tissue removal. We searched articles on morcellator-related injuries published from 1993 through June 2013. In addition, all cases reported to MedSun and the FDA device database (MAUDE) were evaluated for inclusion. We used the search terms \"morcellation,\" \"morcellator,\" \"parasitic,\" and \"retained\" and model name keywords \"Morcellex,\" \"MOREsolution,\" \"PlasmaSORD,\" \"Powerplus,\" \"Rotocut,\" \"SAWALHE,\" \"Steiner,\" and \"X-Tract.\" During the past 15 years, 55 complications were identified. Injuries involved the small and large bowels (n = 31), vascular system (n = 27), kidney (n = 3), ureter (n = 3), bladder (n = 1), and diaphragm (n = 1). Of these injuries, 11 involved more than 1 organ. Complications were identified intraoperatively in most patients (n = 37 [66%]); however, the remainder were not identified until up to 10 days postoperatively. Surgeon inexperience was a contributing factor in most cases in which a cause was ascribed. Six deaths were attributed to morcellator-related complications. Nearly all major complications were identified from the FDA device database and not from the published literature. The laparoscopic morcellator has substantially expanded our ability to complete procedures using minimally invasive techniques. Associated with this opportunity have been increasing reports of major and minor intraoperative complications. These complications are largely unreported, likely because of publication bias associated with catastrophic events. Surgeon experience likely confers some protection against these injuries. Understanding and implementing safe practices associated with the use of the laparoscopic morcellator will reduce these iatrogenic injuries.",

    "Title": "Postmarketing safety of biologics and biological devices.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Regardless of study design, the approval process of biologics and biological devices cannot identify every possible safety concern. Postmarketing safety surveillance can provide information based on real-world use of medical products in heterogeneous populations and is critical for identifying potentially serious adverse events, events that are too rare to be detected during premarketing studies, late complications, and events involving individuals or uses that were not evaluated in clinical trials. PURPOSE: To review why adverse event reporting is important and how the information is used, with emphasis on the points that are most applicable for surgeons and other spine professionals. METHODS: This is an overview of postmarketing safety surveillance. RESULTS: Review of adverse event reports has resulted in safety notifications, label changes, and publications regarding the safety of biologics and biological devices, such as the risk of airway compromise after the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein in cervical spine fusion, the occurrence of a fatal air embolism after the use of a fibrin sealant that had been applied with a spray device, and infections after allograft transplantation of human tissues. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the rapid development of new biologics, postmarketing surveillance is imperative for ensuring that these products are as safe as possible. By reporting adverse events, surgeons and other health care professionals play a key role in improving and refining our understanding of the safety of biologics.",

    "Title": "Increased risk of cardiovascular perforation during ECMO with a bicaval, wire-reinforced cannula.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Cardiac or major vascular perforation is a rare but serious risk of ECMO. We sought to determine if perforation rates are related to cannula design. METHODS: We utilized three methods to evaluate perforation on ECMO. 1. The ELSO registry was queried to establish the historical rate of hemorrhagic pericardial tamponade. 2. ELSO centers were surveyed regarding cannula related perforation events and brands of cannulas used over a four year time period (January 2008-March 2012). 3. The FDA's MAUDE database was reviewed looking for adverse events related to ECMO cannulas. RESULTS: The historical rate of hemorrhagic pericardial tamponade in the ELSO registry was 0.53% (~1985-2010, ELSO registry). In the survey there were eleven reports of cannula-related perforation, 0.74% (11/1482 p-value=0.29) at 7 different ELSO centers with 23 ELSO centers responding (17% response rate). The incidence of perforation was much higher for the wire-reinforced bicaval design 3.6% (10/279) as compared to catheters designed for the atrial position, 0.1% (1/1203, p-value<0.0001). Review of the FDA's MAUDE database revealed 19 adverse events related to the bicaval cannula design, 16 of which were hemorrhagic pericardial effusions or tamponade. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a relatively high rate of cardiac perforation associated with the dual lumen bicaval cannula. This may be related to inherent differences in cannula design or the IVC positioning required by the design.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess all electromechanical morcellators used in gynecology to achieve an objective comparison between them and to make suggestions for improvements in future developments. DESIGN: Literature review. INTERVENTION: The PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and MAUDE databases were systematically searched for all available literature using the terms \"morcellator,\" \"morcellators,\" \"morcellate,\" \"morcellation,\" and \"morcellated.\" All articles with information on morcellation time and morcellated tissue mass or the calculated morcellation rate of electromechanical morcellators used for gynecologic laparoscopic surgery were included. For general data of an existing morcellator, the manufacturer was contacted and Google was searched. Data for morcellation rate, type of procedure, and general characteristics were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven articles were suitable for analysis, and 11 different morcellators were found. In the past decades the morcellation rate has increased. The described morcellation rate ranged from 6.2 to 40.4 g/min. Motor peeling is currently the fastest working principle. Comparing hysterectomy and myomectomy per device, the Morcellex and Rotocut morcellators demonstrated a higher morcellation rate for myomectomy, 25.9 vs 30 g/min and 28.4 vs 33.1 g/min, respectively, although the X-Tract morcellator showed a higher rate for hysterectomy, 14.2 vs 11.7 g/min. CONCLUSION: Over the years, the morcellator has improved with respect to the morcellation rate. However, the morcellation process still has limitations, including tissue scattering, morcellator-related injuries, and the inevitable small blade diameter, which all come at the expense of the morcellation rate and time. Therefore, development of improved morcellators is required, with consideration of the observed limitations.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the adverse events encountered during robotic gynecologic surgery, as reported to the FDA MAUDE database from January 2006 to December 2012. DESIGN: Database search (Canadian Task Force classification III). INTERVENTION: A search of the FDA MAUDE database was performed by brand name \"da Vinci\" and manufacturer \"Intuitive Surgical.\" Reports reflecting gynecologic procedures either by description or procedure name were included. A record of reports was kept to ensure that no duplicates were added. The date and type of event (operator-related error, technical system failure, or surgical injuries attributed to use of the robot) and the clinical outcome were recorded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six percent of reported events (n = 73) resulted in injury, and 8.5% (n = 24) resulted in death. Of note, although adnexal procedures were performed in <3% of the cohort, they accounted for 20% of the fatalities. Twenty-one percent of injuries were attributed to operator-related error, and 14% to technical system failure; 65% were not directly related to use of the robot. Fifteen deaths were reported during planned hysterectomy. Four of those were due to injury to a major blood vessel (iliac artery in 3, and aorta in 1), although a detailed description of how the injury occurred was absent from the event description. CONCLUSION: It is important to continue to evaluate the occurrence of injuries during robot-assisted surgery in an effort to identify unique challenges associated with this advanced technology.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Stent fracture (SF) is an uncommon complication following percutaneous coronary intervention. Previous studies of SF have either been small single-center studies or have reported data mainly from first generation platforms. The FDA MAUDE database was used to identify cases of SF to gain mechanistic insight into procedural and anatomical factors predisposing to this complication, to define treatment and associated clinical outcomes in contemporary and first generation stent platforms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using defined search terms, 376 unique reports of SF were identified in the FDA MAUDE database of which 336 (89.4%) occurred in first generation stent platforms with 96.1% occurring in the Cypher platform. The remaining 40 reports (10.6%) occurred with a similar distribution of cases across different contemporary platforms. Common vessel characteristics associated with SF included calcification, tortuosity, stent overlap, and significant angulation with the most common modality of presentation being in-stent restenosis or stent thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: SF occurs most commonly in first generation Cypher stents with a similar distribution of cases across different contemporary platforms. Optimal treatment strategy remains unclear with the decision to treat and the modality of treatment utilized depending on the type and severity of SF.",

At the ensuing shunt revision in both patients, the silicone housing was fractured and the Siphonguard was disconnected from the Codman Hakim Precision flat-bottom valve. The cause of these failures was not clear since manipulation, bending, and twisting of the valves were not thought to have occurred during implantation. A review of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database revealed 58 cases of silicone housing failure in the Codman Hakim Precision valve with integrated Siphonguard since the year 2000. A single report was found in the databases administered by the Canadian Medical Devices Sentinel Network (CMDSNet). The Codman Hakim Precision valves with integrated Siphonguard are delicate devices that do not withstand the intraoperative handling tolerated by other valves. When these valves are implanted, gentle handling and wide exposures are needed to minimize the risk of valve damage. Valves should be handled according to the manufacturer's instructions. However, in light of this particular pattern of failure, it is recommended that the manufacturer redesign this valve to provide handling tolerance that is characteristic of other valves on the market. The featured cases illustrate the importance of the surgeon's role in postmarket surveillance of medical devices and reporting device failures to the responsible agencies and manufacturers.",

    "Title": "Effectiveness of an electromagnetic feeding tube placement device in detecting inadvertent respiratory placement.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of technology capable of electromagnetically tracking advancement of a feeding tube on a monitoring screen during insertion may enable detection of deviation of the tube from the midline as it advances through the chest, possibly indicating entry of the tube into the right or left main bronchus. PURPOSES: To describe (1) published peer-reviewed studies that report on the detection of malpositioned tubes inserted by an electromagnetic tube placement device, and (2) events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database regarding use of such a device. METHODS: An Ovid MEDLINE search was conducted to locate peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2012 that referred to use of an electromagnetic tube placement device to detect inadvertent respiratory placements of feeding tubes. In addition, an online search of the MAUDE database was conducted for the years 2007 through 2012. RESULTS: The Ovid MEDLINE search yielded 6 studies that referred to respiratory placements; no cases of pneumothorax were reported. The MAUDE database search yielded 21 adverse events associated with use of an electromagnetic tube placement device (including 17 cases of pneumothorax and 2 deaths). As the MAUDE database relies on voluntary reports, this number should not be construed as the incidence of malpositioned tubes during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of clinicians to place feeding tubes correctly by using an electromagnetic tube placement device varies. Thus, it is reasonable to question the wisdom of eliminating radiographic confirmation of tube position before starting feedings.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complications in cosmetic laser and energy based surgery affect a number of patients every year and may cause scars, burns, blisters, and pigmentation damage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate documented complications in cosmetic laser- and energy-based surgeries, determine the most common errors, and recommend a simple procedural sequence to reduce patient complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Adverse Event Reports after cosmetic laser- and energy-based procedures with varied devices were reviewed (N = 494). The laser manufacturer, device used, event type, injury type, cause, operator, and indication for treatment for each case were identified. RESULTS: In the 494 cases reviewed between 2006 and 2011, the most common complications were burns, scarring, blistering, pigmentation damage, and infection. The most common cause of these complications was user error by a healthcare provider (30%), followed by laser device malfunction (20%) and patient error (4%). Indications for treatment were unknown for 69% of cases, and 38% of the cases were an unknown cause of complication. CONCLUSIONS: User error was a major factor in laser surgery complications. To improve safety and reduce errors, we propose the implementation of a procedural sequence for cosmetic laser surgery.",

    "Title": "Over-the-counter (OTC) bruxism splints available on the Internet.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some individuals may now be bypassing their dentists for treatment of bruxism. Self-diagnosed, self-adjusted and self-monitored consumers can access over-the-counter (OTC) bruxism splints via the Internet. While some may regard this market as benefiting consumers there are potential pitfalls that need to be highlighted. These include unevidenced claims of efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To survey OTC bruxism splints available to individuals in the UK via the Internet, categorise their characteristics, and determine any web-based claims or safety warnings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An Internet search was made of OTC bruxism splints available in the UK. The following information was recorded for each OTC splint: the name of the manufacturer, name of the device, its UK price and any claims and safety warnings made either on a major UK retail website or via other UK web retail outlets. In addition, a note was made of any web-based mention of 'CE marking', indicating compliance with the EC Medical Devices Directive's requirements for safety, quality and performance. RESULTS: Safety information is notable for its paucity and is totally lacking on many Internet sites. However, manufacturers are not obliged to display safety information on the Internet, but it must be provided with the product. A search of the MAUDE database showed a number of potentially serious adverse events associated with these splints including choking hazards, tissue damage and occlusal changes. None of the splint designs assure full occlusal coverage. CONCLUSIONS: As with any partial coverage appliance, if worn for protracted periods there may be a risk of unwanted tooth movement. Dentists should report or assist patients with reporting suspected adverse events with OTC splints to the relevant competent authority. In the UK this is the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the safety of permanent and retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters by reviewing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was reviewed from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2012. Product class search criteria were \"filter, intravascular, cardiovascular.\" Type of device used and specific adverse events (AEs) were recorded. RESULTS: For the period January 2009-December 2012, 1,606 reported AEs involving 1,057 IVC filters were identified in the MAUDE database . Of reported AEs, 1,394 (86.8%) involved retrievable inferior vena cava filters (rIVCFs), and 212 (13.2%) involved permanent inferior vena cava filters (pIVCFs) (P < .0001). Reported AEs included fracture, migration, limb embolization, tilt, IVC penetration, venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism, IVC thrombus, and malfunctions during placement. Each specific AE was reported with significantly higher frequency in rIVCFs compared with pIVCFs. The most common reported complication with rIVCFs was fracture, whereas the most commonly reported complications with pIVCFs were placement malfunctions. For rIVCFs, the most commonly reported AE varied depending on filter brand. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database reveals that complications occur with significantly higher frequency with rIVCFs compared with pIVCFs. This finding suggests that the self-reported complication rate with rIVCFs is significantly higher than the self-reported complication rate with pIVCFs.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Battery failure is an uncommon complication of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), but unanticipated battery depletion can have life-threatening consequences. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of a novel mechanism of battery failure in St. Jude Medical Fortify and Unify ICDs. METHODS: Cases of premature Fortify battery failure from a single center are reported. A search (January 1, 2010 through November 30, 2013) for Fortify and Unify premature batter failure was conducted of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE). These findings were supplemented with information provided by St. Jude Medical. RESULTS: Premature battery failure for 2 Fortify ICDs in our practice were attributed to the presence of lithium clusters near the cathode, causing a short circuit and high current drain. The prevalence of this mechanism of premature battery failure was 0.6% in our practice. A MAUDE search identified 39 cases of Fortify (30) and Unify (9) premature battery depletion confirmed by the manufacturer, representing a 0.03% prevalence. Four additional Fortify and 2 Unify cases were identified in MAUDE as suspected premature battery depletion, but in these cases the pulse generator was not returned to the manufacturer for evaluation. St. Jude Medical identified 10 cases of premature battery failure due to lithium clusters in Fortify devices (9) and Unify devices (1), representing a 0.004% prevalence. CONCLUSION: The deposition of lithium clusters near the cathode is a novel mechanism of premature battery failure. The prevalence of this problem is unknown. Providers should be aware of this mechanism for patient management.",

    "Title": "Hysteroscopic morcellation: review of the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the number and type of adverse events associated with hysteroscopic morcellation of intrauterine disease. DESIGN: Systematic review of Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2005 to June 2014 (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING N/A PATIENTS: Women undergoing hysteroscopic surgery for removal of intrauterine polyps or myomas with use of a reciprocating morcellator. INTERVENTIONS: The MAUDE database was searched for the key words \"Hysteroscope,\" \"Hysteroscopic reciprocating morcellator,\" \"Interlace,\" \"MyoSure,\" \"Smith & Nephew,\" and \"TRUCLEAR,\" to identify reported incidences of device malfunction, injury, or death. A total of 119 adverse events were analyzed. Reports were reviewed individually and categorized by date of occurrence, type of morcellation device, type of complication, and a brief description. Each company was contacted to provide an estimate of the number of procedures performed or units sold to date. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: From 2005 to June 2014, 119 adverse events were reported to the MAUDE database. On the basis of severity, adverse events were categorized as major or minor complications. Major events included intubation/admission to an intensive care unit (n = 14), bowel damage (n = 12), hysterectomy (n = 6), and death (n = 2). Minor events included uterine perforation requiring no other treatment (n = 29), device failure (n = 25), uncomplicated fluid overload (n = 19), postoperative bleeding controlled using noninvasive measures (n = 6), and pelvic infection (n = 4). These events were then categorized according to manufacturer. The number of adverse events reported to the MAUDE database was divided by the total units sold as a surrogate for the estimated number of procedures performed. Understanding the limitation of the numbers used as a numerator and denominator, we concluded that adverse events complicated hysteroscopic morcellation in <0.1% cases. CONCLUSIONS: The suction-based, mechanical energy, rotating tubular cutting system was developed to overcome adverse events that occur during traditional resectoscopy. On the basis of acknowledged limited information from the MAUDE database, it seems that life-threatening complications such as fluid overload, uterine perforation, and bleeding do occur with hysteroscopic morcellation but less frequently than with traditional electrocautery.",

    "Title": "Pseudoaneurysm formation after medtronic freestyle porcine aortic bioprosthesis implantation: a word of caution.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A growing literature describes aneurysmal deterioration after implantation of the stentless porcine aortic Medtronic Freestyle bioprosthesis (MFB; Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN), with some suggesting inadequate tissue fixation with immune response as a cause. However, disjointed reports make the significance of these findings difficult to interpret. We address this concern by aggregating available data. METHODS: We reviewed institutional data, the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience registry, and the medical literature for mention of aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm after MFB. Case details were aggregated, and the rate of aneurysmal deterioration was estimated. Immunohistopathologic examination of institutional explanted specimens was performed to elucidate a cause. RESULTS: We found 42 cases of aneurysmal deterioration with adequate detail for analysis; all occurred with full root replacement and valve sizes ranging from 23 to 29 mm. The rate of aneurysmal deterioration considering all data sources was 1.1% (9 of 851; 95% confidence interval, 0.5% to 2.0%) vs 4.7% (4 of 86; 95% confidence interval, 1.3% to 11.5%) at our institution, where yearly surveillance imaging is performed. Rate of aneurysmal deterioration appeared constant until 5 years after the operation; however, events are reported out to 10 years. Consistent with previous reports, histopathology demonstrated an immune cell infiltrate in areas of MFB wall breakdown. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal deterioration is an increasingly described complication of MFB implantation as a full root, with an incidence as high as 4.7%. Given the observed immune reaction and lack of occurrence in smaller (19-mm and 21-mm) valve sizes, inadequate pressure fixation of larger valves is a potential etiology. Patients with MFB require annual surveillance imaging, and consideration of this complication should factor into preoperative decision making because treatment mandates redo root replacement, which may not be feasible in high-risk patients.",

    "Title": "Risk of transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and related \"superbugs\" during gastrointestinal endoscopy.",
    "Abstract": "To evaluate the risk of transmission of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and their related superbugs during gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Reports of outbreaks linked to GI endoscopes contaminated with different types of infectious agents, including CRE and their related superbugs, were reviewed. Published during the past 30 years, both prior to and since CRE's emergence, these reports were obtained by searching the peer-reviewed medical literature (via the United States National Library of Medicine's \"MEDLINE\" database); the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, or \"MAUDE\"; and the Internet (via Google's search engine). This review focused on an outbreak of CRE in 2013 following the GI endoscopic procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or ERCP, performed at \"Hospital X\" located in the suburbs of Chicago (IL; United States). Part of the largest outbreak of CRE in United States history, the infection and colonization of 10 and 28 of this hospital's patients, respectively, received considerable media attention and was also investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which published a report about this outbreak in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), in 2014. This report, along with the results of an independent inspection of Hospital X's infection control practices following this CRE outbreak, were also reviewed. While this article focuses primarily on the prevention of transmissions of CRE and their related superbugs in the GI endoscopic setting, some of its discussion and recommendations may also apply to other healthcare settings, to other types of flexible endoscopes, and to other types of transmissible infectious agents. This review found that GI endoscopy is an important risk factor for the transmission of CRE and their related superbugs, having been recently associated with patient morbidity and mortality following ERCP. The CDC reported in MMWR that the type of GI endoscope, known as an ERCP endoscope, that Hospital X used to perform ERCP in 2013 on the 38 patients who became infected or colonized with CRE might be particularly challenging to clean and disinfect, because of the complexity of its physical design. If performed in strict accordance with the endoscope manufacturer's labeling, supplemented as needed with professional organizations' published guidelines, however, current practices for reprocessing GI endoscopes, which include high-level disinfection, are reportedly adequate for the prevention of transmission of CRE and their related superbugs. Several recommendations are provided to prevent CRE transmissions in the healthcare setting. CRE transmissions are not limited to contaminated GI endoscopes and also have been linked to other reusable flexible endoscopic instrumentation, including bronchoscopes and cystoscopes. In conclusion, contaminated GI endoscopes, particularly those used during ERCP, have been causally linked to outbreaks of CRE and their related superbugs, with associated patient morbidity and mortality. Thorough reprocessing of these complex reusable instruments is necessary to prevent disease transmission and ensure patient safety during GI endoscopy. Enhanced training and monitoring of reprocessing staffers to verify the proper cleaning and brushing of GI endoscopes, especially the area around, behind and near the forceps elevator located at the distal end of the ERCP endoscope, are recommended. If the ERCP endoscope features a narrow and exposed channel that houses a wire connecting the GI endoscope's control head to this forceps elevator, then this channel's complete reprocessing, including its flushing with a detergent using a procedure validated for effectiveness, is also emphasized.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we show how we have applied the Clinical Narrative Temporal Relation Ontology (CNTRO) and its associated temporal reasoning system (the CNTRO Timeline Library) to trend temporal information within medical device adverse event report narratives. 238 narratives documenting occurrences of late stent thrombosis adverse events from the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturing and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database were annotated and evaluated using the CNTRO Timeline Library to identify, order, and calculate the duration of temporal events. The CNTRO Timeline Library had a 95% accuracy in correctly ordering events within the 238 narratives. 41 narratives included an event in which the duration was documented, and the CNTRO Timeline Library had an 80% accuracy in correctly determining these durations. 77 narratives included documentation of a duration between events, and the CNTRO Timeline Library had a 76% accuracy in determining these durations. This paper also includes an example of how this temporal output from the CNTRO ontology can be used to verify recommendations for length of drug administration, and proposes that these same tools could be applied to other medical device adverse event narratives in order to identify currently unknown temporal trends.",

    "Title": "The dangers of dental devices as reported in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a study to determine the frequency and type of adverse events (AEs) associated with dental devices reported to the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The authors downloaded and reviewed the dental device-related AEs reported to MAUDE from January 1, 1996, through December 31,2011. RESULTS: MAUDE received a total of 1,978,056 reports between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2011. Among these reports, 28,046 (1.4%) AE reports were associated with dental devices. Within the dental AE reports that had event type information, 17,261 reported injuries, 7,777 reported device malfunctions, and 66 reported deaths. Among the 66 entries classified as death reports, 52 reported a death in the description; the remaining were either misclassified or lacked sufficient information in the report to determine whether a death had occurred. Of the dental device-associated AEs, 53.5% pertained to endosseous implants. CONCLUSIONS: A plethora of devices are used in dental care. To achieve Element 1 of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Patient Safety Initiative, clinicians and researchers must be able to monitor the safety of dental devices. Although MAUDE was identified by the authors as essentially the sole source of this valuable information on adverse events, their investigations led them to conclude that MAUDE had substantial limitations that prevent it from being the broad-based patient safety sentinel the profession requires. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: As potential contributors to MAUDE, dental care teams play a key role in improving the profession's access to information about the safety of dental devices.",

    "Title": "FDA MAUDE data on complications with lasers, light sources, and energy-based devices.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is essential for physicians to be fully informed regarding adverse events and malfunctions associated with medical devices that occur in routine practice. There is limited information on this important issue in the medical literature, and it is mostly based on initial studies and case reports. More advanced knowledge regarding device adverse events is necessary to guide physicians towards providing safe treatments. The FDA requires that manufacturers and device users submit medical device reports (MDRs) for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction. The database of MDRs, entitled Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) enables the FDA to monitor device performance and identify potential safety issues. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the following search strategy to identify reported adverse events. We searched the MAUDE electronic database on the FDA website in December 2013: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm We collected all reported cases between 1991 and December 2013. The search terms utilized included a comprehensive list of device manufacturers, specific product names, and the wavelengths/technology of the devices used in the field of dermatology. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1257 MDRs. Forty-five MDRs were excluded due to insufficient data. The data is broken down into the adverse events observed, such as, but not limited to: blistering, burns, scarring, dyschromia, fat loss, and nerve palsy. The MDRs describe the adverse event and attempt to determine if it was related to device malfunction versus operator error. Radiofrequency devices, diode lasers, and intense pulsed light devices were the most commonly reported devices related to injuries. CONCLUSION: 1257 MDRs, from a myriad of devices used in dermatology, have been reported to the FDA as of December 2013. Despite the underreporting of adverse events, the MAUDE database is an untapped resource of post-market surveillance of medical devices. The database can offer additional information, which combined with the initial device studies and published case reports from our colleagues, will help raise awareness and improve patient safety.",

    "Title": "Morbidity and mortality after thermal venous ablations.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of saphenous vein reflux has evolved over the years with the development of thermal ablation techniques. This study was designed to analyze the complications of endovenous ablation (EVA) using data from an open, voluntary national database. METHODS: We analyzed 349 adverse events of endovenous laser (EVLT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2000 to June 2012. Outcomes of interest were pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death, and device failures (i.e. broken laser tip, broken sheath). RESULTS: Two hundred and three (58%) reports were patient-related injuries and the other 146 (42%) device-related failures. More complications were related to RFA compared to EVLT (216 vs. 133 procedures). Thirty (8%) non-fatal PEs and 123 (35%) DVTs were described. There were 7 (2%) periprocedural deaths, all from PE. Of the 135 device failure reports, 41(30%) required surgical intervention. Despite an increasing number of procedures, reported events peaked around 2008 and stabilized since then. Over the past 5 years, the incidence of adverse events reported for EVLT and RFA were 1 and 2 per 10,000 procedures. The complication ratio over the years was <1:2500 for DVT, <1:10,000 for PE, <1:50,000 for death. CONCLUSION: EVA has gained high acceptance worldwide but the risks tend to be overlooked. Despite a very low complication rate, mortality has been reported. The complications found in MAUDE represent only a fraction as the majority of the practitioners are not aware of this database. Further investigation by a large national registry is warranted to better define the real magnitude of EVA complications.",

    "Title": "Locked Deflection During Flexible Ureteroscopy: Incidence and Elucidation of the Mechanism of an Underreported Complication.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flexible ureteroscopy (URS) is widely implemented with a well-defined safety profile and low complication rates. Although rare, locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope in the upper tract is a potentially serious complication with poorly understood etiology and is likely underreported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We attempted to capture all cases of locked deflection during URS by performing an anonymous, online computer survey targeting members of the Endourological Society. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and published literature were queried to find additional cases. The indication for URS, method of ureteroscope removal, patient outcomes, incident reporting, and explanations provided by the manufacturer or third party repair service were obtained whenever possible. RESULTS: In total, 10 cases of locked deflection during flexible URS were identified. Survey responses were obtained from 250/2424 (10.3%) endourologists polled. Locked deflection was noted by 8/250 (3.2%). The reported literature and MAUDE database identified one case each. Successful removal was noted in four using retrograde manipulation techniques while a percutaneous approach was used in three patients. Open surgery was needed in two cases because of resultant ureteral avulsion, and in one case, an open ureterotomy was needed for ureteroscope extraction. According to our survey, locked deflection was reported to the patient in 4/8 cases, the hospital in 3/8 cases, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 0/8 cases. The two cases reported outside of our survey both notified the FDA. The minority of respondents (2/8), including our group, felt improper surgical technique was responsible for resultant locked deflection. Specifically, removal of a completely deflected ureteroscope through a stenotic infundibulum should be avoided. Rather, in such a situation, the ureteroscope should be straightened under fluoroscopy before being withdrawn. CONCLUSIONS: Locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope is rare and underreported. Some cases are attributed to surgical technique, and awareness is crucial for avoidance of this complication.",

    "Abstract": "Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is an important and evolving form of insulin delivery, which is mainly used for people with type 1 diabetes. However, even with modern insulin pumps, errors of insulin infusion can occur due to pump failure, insulin infusion set (IIS) blockage, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error, or a combination of these. Users are therefore exposed to significant and potentially fatal hazards: interruption of insulin infusion can result in hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis; conversely, delivery of excessive insulin can cause severe hypoglycemia. Nevertheless, the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of CSII remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore joined forces to review the systems in place for evaluating the safety of pumps from a clinical perspective. We found that useful information held by the manufacturing companies is not currently shared in a sufficiently transparent manner. Public availability of adverse event (AE) reports on the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is potentially a rich source of safety information but is insufficiently utilized due to the current configuration of the system; the comparable database in Europe (European Databank on Medical Devices [EUDAMED]) is not publicly accessible. Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to \"predicate\" products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help health care teams to educate and support users and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials. At present, there are significant differences in the regulatory systems between the US and European Union at both pre- and postmarketing stages; improvements in the European system are more urgently required. This statement concludes with a series of recommended specific actions for \"meknovigilance\" (i.e., a standardized safety approach to technology) that could be implemented to address the shortcomings we highlight.",

    "Abstract": "Few systematic surveys have dealt with the potential procedural risks associated with the use of retrievable intracranial stents [Solitaire Flow Restoration (Solitaire FR)], which have become effective tools for recanalizing acutely occluded cerebral arteries. The aim of this study was to present the real-world experiences of Solitaire-FR-related adverse events by reviewing the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) as published on the United States Food and Drug Administration website. In total, 85 adverse events related to the use of the Solitaire FR stent were reported between March 2012 and October 2014. In 80 patients these adverse events were attributable to inadvertent detachment of the device. Thirteen of these 80 patients (16%) died after the procedure. Morbidity data were available in 62 patients, among whom 11 (18%) had suffered a procedure-related injury. Detachment occurred at the first, second, and third pass in nine (21%), 21 (49%), and 13 (30%) of the 43 patients for whom this information was available, respectively. Resistance was perceived by the physician during retrieval of the device in 12 patients, and lesion characteristics were noted in 13. A rescue maneuver was reported in 20 (25%) of the 80 patients in whom the adverse event was attributable to detachment of the device, resulting in flow reestablishment in 13 (65%). The risk of inadvertent detachment during stent retrieval cannot be overemphasized in real-world scenarios, and careful consideration of the \"dos and don'ts\" is essential for the achievement of a safe procedure.",

    "Title": "Safety and Procedural Success of Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion With the Lariat Device: A Systematic Review of Published Reports and Analytic Review of the FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Lariat device has received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for soft-tissue approximation and is being widely used off-label for left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion. A comprehensive analysis of safety and effectiveness has not been reported. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review of published literature to assess safety and procedural success, defined as successful closure of the LAA during the index procedure, of the Lariat device. We performed a formal analytic review of the FDA MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database to compile adverse event reports from real-world practice with the Lariat. DATA SOURCES: For the systematic review, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2007 through August 2014 to identify all studies reporting use of the Lariat device in 3 or more patients. The FDA MAUDE database was queried for adverse events reports related to Lariat use. DATA EXTRACTIONS AND SYNTHESIS: Data were abstracted in duplicate by 2 physician reviewers. Events from published literature were pooled using a generic inverse variance weighting with a random effects model. Cumulative and individual adverse events were also reported using the FDA MAUDE data set. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Procedural adverse events and procedural success. RESULTS: In the systematic review, 5 reports of Lariat device use in 309 participants were identified. Specific complications weighted for inverse of variance of individual studies were urgent need for cardiac surgery (2.3%; 7 of 309 procedures) and death (0.3%; 1 of 309 procedures). Procedural success was 90.3% (279 of 309 procedures). In the FDA MAUDE database, there were 35 unique reports of adverse events with use of the Lariat device. Among these, we identified 5 adverse event reports that noted pericardial effusion and death and an additional 23 reported urgent cardiac surgery without mention of death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This review of published reports and case reports identified risks of adverse events with off-label use of the Lariat device for LAA exclusion. Formal, controlled investigations into the safety and efficacy of the device for this indication are warranted.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: This review aims to objectively assess the efficacy and safety of uterine manipulators as reported in scientific literature. Furthermore, it evaluates as to which manipulator best suits which surgical procedure. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, COCHRANE, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Science Direct and the MAUDE database were searched. Technical information was retrieved from the manufacturers. RESULTS: 25 articles covering 10 uterine manipulators were found. Studies regarding implementation and use of manipulators are scarce; only two surveys were found comparing different manipulators. Moreover, clinical evidence proving the efficacy of manipulators with respect to prevention of complications, inherent to laparoscopic surgery, does not exist. CONCLUSION: The use of uterine manipulators is well established and it is clear that uterine manipulators offer the easiest way to handle the uterus during surgery. However, detailed information regarding efficacy and safety is scarce. Clinical evidence substantiating the assumed mechanism of prevention of ureter injuries was not found. Our review did not find the optimal manipulator. Some are more versatile than others and not all instruments are appropriate for all types of surgery. Therefore, gynecologists should choose the manipulator that best suits the type of surgery that is performed.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adverse events associated with electromechanical morcellation as reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of an established database (Canadian Task Force classification III). INTERVENTION: A search of the MAUDE database for terms associated with commercially available electromechanical morcellation devices was undertaken for events leading to injury or death between 2004 and 2014. Data, including the types of injury, need for conversion to open surgery, type of open surgery, and clinical outcomes, were extracted from the records. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, 9 events associated with death and 215 events associated with patient injury or significant delay of the surgical procedure were recorded. These involved 137 device failures, 51 organ injuries, and the morcellation of 27 previously undiagnosed malignancies. Of the 9 deaths, 1 was associated with organ injury, and the other 8 were associated with morcellation of cancer. Of the 27 undiagnosed cancers, 5 were reported by the manufacturer, 8 were reported by the patient or family, 9 were reported by medical or news reports, 2 were reported by medical professionals, and 3 were due to litigation. Morcellation of an undiagnosed malignancy was first reported to the database in December 2013. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database appears to detect perioperative events, such as device failures and organ injury at the time of surgery, but appears to be poor at detecting late events after surgery, such as the potential spread of cancer. Outcome registries are likely a more efficient means of tracking potential long-term adverse events associated with surgical devices.",

    "Title": "Surgical Energy-Based Device Injuries and Fatalities Reported to the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Energy-based devices are used in virtually every operation. Our purposes were to describe causes of energy-based device complications leading to injury or death, and to determine if common mechanisms leading to injury or death can be identified. STUDY DESIGN: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for surgical energy-based device injuries and deaths reported over 20 years (January 1994 to December 2013). Device-related complications were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: We analyzed 178 deaths and 3,553 injuries. Common patterns of complications were: thermal burns, 63% (n = 2,353); hemorrhage, 17% (n = 642); mechanical failure of device, 12% (n = 442); and fire, 8% (n = 294). Events were identified intraoperatively in 82% (3,056), inpatient postoperatively in 9% (n = 351), and after discharge in 9% (n = 324). Of the deaths, 12% (n = 22) occurred after discharge home. Common mechanisms for thermal burn injuries were: direct application, 30% (n = 694); dispersive electrode burn, 29% (n = 657); and insulation failure, 14% (n = 324). Thermal injury was the most common reason for death (39%, n = 70). The mechanism for these thermal injuries was most frequently direct application (84%, n = 59, p < 0.001 vs all other mechanisms). Fires were most common with monopolar \"Bovie\" instruments (88%, n = 258, p < 0.001 vs all other devices) when they were used in head and neck operations (66%, n = 193, p < 0.001 vs all other locations). CONCLUSIONS: Complications due to energy-based devices occur from 4 main causes: thermal burn, hemorrhage, mechanical failure, and fire. Thermal direct application injuries are the most common reason for both injury and death.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following increased rates of inside-out abrasion with the St Jude Medical Riata lead, the Durata implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) lead was introduced with modifications intended to increase abrasion resistance. Recent case reports have described insulation failures of the Durata. OBJECTIVE: To determine if increased rates of abrasion-related failure are present with the Durata lead. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of insulation failure of the Durata lead from 2014. Comparison was made to other ICD leads. Incidence was estimated and case characteristics were compared. RESULTS: The estimated incidence of abrasion was significantly higher for the Durata lead than for the Boston Scientific Endotak or the Medtronic Quattro leads. The mode of abrasion was most often lead-to-can, as compared to \"inside-out\" abrasion with the Riata lead. Full-thickness abrasion was associated with failure to defibrillate or inappropriate therapy. Four patients had failure of therapy or death. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate higher rates of insulation failures of the Durata lead, despite design modifications. External abrasion from the pulse generator to the adjacent lead within the device pocket was the most common etiology. Shocks unmasked previously undetected abrasion, resulting in failure to defibrillate. Data are presented indicating a possible time dependency to abrasion risk. This limited query suggests need for ongoing scrutiny of Durata lead performance. Careful inspection of Durata leads at the time of ICD replacement is warranted, as are vigorous attempts to gather information about terminal events in patients with Durata leads.",

    "Abstract": "In June 2012, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about the risk of catheter entrapment associated with Onyx embolization. We used our experience, literature review, and FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data review to identify five strategies to address catheter entrapment: 1/. Surgical resection of vessel at point of entrapment of catheter and retraction from exterior portion at the femoral region; 2/. Advancing and closing the loop of snare over the entrapped catheter followed by retraction; 3/. Advancing the distal access catheter over the entrapped catheter and retraction with forward movement of the distal access catheters; 4/. Inflation of balloon catheter coaxial to the entrapped catheter with subsequent retraction; and 5/. Intravascular retention and internalization of microcatheter. In the MAUDE data, there were 77 reports of catheter entrapment with Onyx embolization; microcatheter was retracted by surgical excision in 15, endovascular snare or other retriever devices in 5, deliberately entrapped inside the vessel using stent in 1, and left without intervention within intravascular compartment in 27 patients.",

    "Abstract": "UNLABELLED: Vaginal mesh has been a valuable tool in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. As our knowledge of the long-term outcomes and complications of this product has evolved, however, vaginal mesh has become the subject of legal scrutiny. Therefore, it is imperative that physicians understand pertinent litigation techniques to optimize their informed consent and documentation processes and protect themselves. OBJECTIVES: Our objective is to familiarize physicians who use vaginal mesh with how law suits involving transvaginal mesh are construed. We also describe the current medicolegal environment surrounding the use of these products. METHODS: The food and drug administration public safety communications, food and drug administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, and LexisNexis legal search engine were used to review data relevant to current vaginal mesh litigation. This information was used to create a medicolegal review. RESULTS: Litigation involving transvaginal mesh follows 3 paths. The first consists of claims against the manufacture of transvaginal mesh with allegations, such as design defects, failure to warn, and misrepresentation. The second is a defensive legal strategy called the learned intermediary doctrine, used by manufacturers to shift liability from themselves to surgeons. The manufacturers claim that the duty to inform patients of potential complications lies with the surgeon. The third involves claims by patients against surgeons for lack of informed consent, alleging that they were not sufficiently informed of potential complications associated with transvaginal mesh before insertion. CONCLUSIONS: To lessen the liability, a surgeon using transvaginal mesh should inform patients of potential complications associated with the products and document informed consent in their medical records.",

    "Title": "Structural Mechanics Predictions Relating to Clinical Coronary Stent Fracture in a 5 Year Period in FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "Endovascular stents are the mainstay of interventional cardiovascular medicine. Technological advances have reduced biological and clinical complications but not mechanical failure. Stent strut fracture is increasingly recognized as of paramount clinical importance. Though consensus reigns that fractures can result from material fatigue, how fracture is induced and the mechanisms underlying its clinical sequelae remain ill-defined. In this study, strut fractures were identified in the prospectively maintained Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE), covering years 2006-2011, and differentiated based on specific coronary artery implantation site and device configuration. These data, and knowledge of the extent of dynamic arterial deformations obtained from patient CT images and published data, were used to define boundary conditions for 3D finite element models incorporating multimodal, multi-cycle deformation. The structural response for a range of stent designs and configurations was predicted by computational models and included estimation of maximum principal, minimum principal and equivalent plastic strains. Fatigue assessment was performed with Goodman diagrams and safe/unsafe regions defined for different stent designs. Von Mises stress and maximum principal strain increased with multimodal, fully reversed deformation. Spatial maps of unsafe locations corresponded to the identified locations of fracture in different coronary arteries in the clinical database. These findings, for the first time, provide insight into a potential link between patient adverse events and computational modeling of stent deformation. Understanding of the mechanical forces imposed under different implantation conditions may assist in rational design and optimal placement of these devices.",

    "Title": "Ureteral Avulsion Associated with Ureteroscopy: Insights from the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flexible and semirigid ureteroscopy (URS) are widely performed for the treatment of upper tract calculi and tumors. Ureteral avulsion is a rare, but devastating complication of endoscopic stone removal having multiple possible etiologies. Awareness and avoidance of this rare complication depend on identifying responsible mechanisms. This study examines the situations in which ureteral avulsion occurs as described anonymously in the Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was systematically reviewed to account for all reported complications of flexible and semirigid URS. Keywords \"ureteroscopy, injury, death, malfunction and other\" were entered in the database and medical device reports were reviewed to capture any cases resulting in ureteral avulsion. Attention was paid to the type of ureteroscope involved and the mechanism for avulsion. RESULTS: A total of 104 entries were found detailing the reported complications of flexible and semirigid URS. Ureteral avulsion was clearly noted in six reports with flexible (2) and semirigid ureteroscopes (4). Potential mechanisms included locked deflection of a flexible ureteroscope (1), bunching of the distal bending rubber in a flexible ureteroscope (1), scabbard avulsion (3), and stone basketing (1). CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of ureteral avulsion cannot truly be determined from this study, some potentially novel mechanisms for this rare complication are observed. This may target future educational efforts to maximize awareness and avoidance of this complication.",

    "Title": "New Minimum Relative Humidity Requirements Are Expected to Lead to More Medical Device Failures.",
    "Abstract": "In 2010, the Addendum D to ASHRAE Standard 170, \"Ventilation of healthcare facilities,\" lowered the minimum relative humidity (RH) requirement of anesthetizing locations (including operating rooms, operating/surgical cystoscopic rooms, delivery rooms (Caesarean), recovery rooms, critical and intensive care, newborn intensive care, treatment rooms, trauma rooms (crisis or shock), laser eye rooms, newborn nursery suites, and endoscopy rooms) from 30 % to 20 %. The new minimum limit was adopted based on the results of a review paper that suggested that lowering humidity levels will have little or no impact on providing a safe environment for patients, staff, or medical equipment. That review paper reached this conclusion by assuming that there were no medical device failures due to electrostatic discharge (ESD). However, in an examination of the FDA's MAUDE database of reported defects and recalls, we identified numerous medical device failures explicitly due to ESD. This paper presents technical reliability and safety concerns regarding the new guidelines and recommends that such changes should not be implemented and that the guidelines should be revoked.",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous burns associated with microscope-use are perceived to be uncommon adverse events in microsurgery. Currently, it is unknown what factors are associated with these iatrogenic events. In this report, we describe the case of a 1-year-old patient who suffered a full thickness skin burn from a surgical microscope after a L4-S1 laminectomy. Additionally, we present a systematic review of the literature that assessed the preoperative risk, outcome, and management of iatrogenic microscope skin burns. Lastly, a summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of voluntary adverse events was reviewed and analyzed for clinical cases of microscope thermal injuries. The systematic literature review identified only seven articles related to microsurgery-related cutaneous burns. From these seven studies, 15 clinical cases of iatrogenic skin burns were extracted for analysis. The systematic review of the FDA MAUDE database revealed only 60 cases of cutaneous burns associated with surgical microscopes since 2004. Few cases of microscope burns have been described in the literature; this report is, to our knowledge, one of the first comprehensive reports of this iatrogenic event in the literature.",

Regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggest manufacturers should investigate use-related problems that have occurred in the past with devices that are similar to the one under development. Publically available device incident databases, such as the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, are a good source of information. However, haphazard searches of these databases can be confounding and unproductive. This paper presents a systematic approach to conducting the database searches, analysing the data and reporting the findings in a meaningful way.

    "Title": "Ventilator-Related Adverse Events: A Taxonomy and Findings From 3 Incident Reporting Systems.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2009, researchers from Johns Hopkins University's Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality; public agencies, including the FDA; and private partners, including the Emergency Care Research Institute and the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) Safety Intelligence Patient Safety Organization, sought to form a public-private partnership for the promotion of patient safety (P5S) to advance patient safety through voluntary partnerships. The study objective was to test the concept of the P5S to advance our understanding of safety issues related to ventilator events, to develop a common classification system for categorizing adverse events related to mechanical ventilators, and to perform a comparison of adverse events across different adverse event reporting systems. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of ventilator-related adverse events reported in 2012 from the following incident reporting systems: the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority's Patient Safety Reporting System, UHC's Safety Intelligence Patient Safety Organization database, and the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Once each organization had its dataset of ventilator-related adverse events, reviewers read the narrative descriptions of each event and classified it according to the developed common taxonomy. RESULTS: A Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority, FDA, and UHC search provided 252, 274, and 700 relevant reports, respectively. The 3 event types most commonly reported to the UHC and the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority's Patient Safety Reporting System databases were airway/breathing circuit issue, human factor issues, and ventilator malfunction events. The top 3 event types reported to the FDA were ventilator malfunction, power source issue, and alarm failure. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that (1) through the development of a common taxonomy, adverse events from 3 reporting systems can be evaluated, (2) the types of events reported in each database were related to the purpose of the database and the source of the reports, resulting in significant differences in reported event categories across the 3 systems, and (3) a public-private collaboration for investigating ventilator-related adverse events under the P5S model is feasible.",

    "Title": "Adverse events of gastric electrical stimulators recorded in the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) Registry.",
    "Abstract": "UNLABELLED: The role of gastric electrical stimulation for patients with refractory symptoms of gastroparesis remains controversial. Open label studies suggest benefit while randomized controlled trials did not demonstrate differences between active and sham intervention. Using a voluntary reporting system of the Federal Drug Administration, we examined the type and frequency of adverse events. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) databank using the keyword 'Enterra' for the time between January of 2001 and October of 2015. We abstracted information about the year of stimulator implantation, the year and type of adverse effect, the resulting intervention and outcome if available. RESULTS: A total of 1587 entries described adverse effects related the GES. Only 36 of the reports listed perioperative complications. The vast majority described problems that could be classified as patient concerns, local complications, or system failure. The most common problem related lack or loss of efficacy, followed by pain or complications affecting the pocket site. A subset of 801 reports provided information about the time between system implant and registration of concerns, which gradually declined over time. More than one third (35.7%) of the reported adverse events prompted surgical correction. CONCLUSION: The number of voluntarily reported adverse events and the high likelihood of repeated surgical interventions clearly demonstrate the potential downside of gastric electrical stimulation. Physicians considering this intervention will need to carefully weigh these risks and include this information when counseling or consenting patients.",

    "Title": "Analysis of adverse events with use of orthodontic sequential aligners as reported in the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sequential aligners (SAs) introduced about a decade ago, changed the practice of orthodontics as we knew it but the adverse events and reactions (AER) associated with SA is not known. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a reliable database that has AERs reported. The manuscript attempts to review the AER associated with SA using the MAUDE database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors downloaded and reviewed the SA-related AER from MAUDE for a period of 5 years. In-depth analysis of the site and nature of intraoral and extraoral AERs were performed. We attempted to calculate the probability of pathologies being directly related to SA use, using Bayes' theorem. RESULTS: In the study period of 5 years, 175 cases of AER registered with MAUDE database owing to use of SA. Of the 175 cases, 129 (73.71%) instances were mandatory reports filed by the manufacturer. Of all AERs, 32 (18.29%) cases had been diagnosed/suspected to have an allergic reaction, 20 (11.43%) of them with anaphylactic reaction and 4 (2.29%) of them with angioedema. Lesions involving tongue, throat, and lip such as soreness, inflammation, and hives were more commonly reported. In addition, 12 cases (6.86%) reported of nausea, 11 (6.29%) of gastrointestinal issues (stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting), 13 (7.43%) of neuromuscular issues (muscle cramps, spasm, and pain), 13 (7.43%) of cough, 10 (5.71%) of persistent headache, 3 (1.71%) of fever, and 12 (6.86%) of cardiac-related issues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The AERs associated with SA has been described. Though the MAUDE database is not an exact, wholesome and reliable source to identify the potential AER, currently, it is the only available source of AERs associated with SA use. The nature of AERs with the use of SA and its potential pathogenesis and implications has been discussed.",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with ultrasonic scalers: A manufacturer and user facility device experience database analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to determine the frequency and type of adverse events (AEs) associated with ultrasonic scaler reported to the Food and Drug Administration manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed the ultrasonic scaler units (USU) related AEs reported to MAUDE from October 1, 1995, to September 31, 2015. Analyses of details collected are presented. RESULTS: MAUDE received a total of 667 unique USU-related AE reports. Of 667 cases, MAUDE classified 628 instances (94.2%) as malfunction 27 (4%) as injurious, 10 (1.5%) as others, and 2 (0.3%) claiming the use of USU as cause of death. Of the 667 cases, 511 (76.6%) were used for endodontic application, and 147 (22%) as scaler applications. In 512 (76.8%) instances, there was separation of the tips, posing danger to patients or users, and 112 (16.8%) instances of overheating, 12 (1.8%) instances of breakage, and electrical issues in 8 (1.2%) instances. These AE resulted in 19 instances of thermal injury, 2 suspicious deaths, and hearing loss in 3 cases. In 4 cases, patient swallowed broken parts requiring additional medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Use of USU, a Class 2 device without exemption, carries a degree of risk to patient's safety, if not properly used. As of today, MAUDE data is the only reliable source of AE until another database or such study is carried out. Certain AE that has been largely anecdotal, such as hearing loss has been reported in this study. The findings from study reiterate that more in-depth analysis of AE of USU is needed. Until then operator needs to take all precautions to avoid AE when using USU.",

    "Title": "Insulin Pump Malfunction During Hospitalization: Two Case Reports.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insulin pump malfunctions and failures continue to occur; however, more severe malfunctions such as the \"runaway pump\" phenomenon are rarely reported. This article describes two cases of pump malfunction in which pump users appear to have received an unsolicited bolus of insulin resulting in severe episodes of hypoglycemia during hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Both cases of insulin pump malfunction occurred in the inpatient setting at a large academic medical center in the United States. An analysis of the corresponding insulin pump downloads was performed. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for similar cases involving Medtronic (Northridge, CA) insulin pumps using the terms \"pump,\" \"infusion,\" \"insulin AND malfunction AND Medtronic.\" RESULTS: The two cases described show remarkable similarities, each demonstrating a severe hypoglycemic event preceded by an infusion site change followed by an alarm. In both cases a rapid spraying of insulin was reported. The insulin pump downloads validated much of the patients' and medical staff's descriptions of events. The FDA's MAUDE database search revealed 425 cases meeting our search term criteria. All cases were reviewed. Seven cases were identified involving independent movement of the reservoir piston. CONCLUSIONS: The cases detailed are the first to describe an insulin pump malfunction of this nature in the hospital setting involving unsolicited insulin boluses leading to severe hypoglycemia. The cases are particularly compelling in that they were witnessed by medical personnel. Providers and patients should receive instruction education on the recognition and management of insulin pump malfunction.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery has rapidly increased during the last decade. Understanding the causes of adverse events and their impact on patients in robot-assisted surgery will help improve systems and operational practices to avoid incidents in the future. METHODS: By developing an automated natural language processing tool, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the adverse events reported to the publicly available MAUDE database (maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient injuries and deaths. RESULTS: During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2-92.7 per 100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower numbers of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery in the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures. Adoption of advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic surgical systems and enhanced mechanisms for adverse event reporting may reduce these preventable incidents in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Many inferior vena cava (IVC) filter types, along with their specific risks and complications, are not recognized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the various FDA-approved IVC filter types to determine device-specific risks, as a way to help identify patients who may benefit from ongoing follow-up versus prompt filter retrieval. An evidence-based electronic search (FDA Premarket Notification, MEDLINE, FDA MAUDE) was performed to identify all IVC filter types and device-specific complications from 1980 to 2014. Twenty-three IVC filter types (14 retrievable, 9 permanent) were identified. The devices were categorized as follows: conical (n = 14), conical with umbrella (n = 1), conical with cylindrical element (n = 2), biconical with cylindrical element (n = 2), helical (n = 1), spiral (n = 1), and complex (n = 1). Purely conical filters were associated with the highest reported risks of penetration (90-100%). Filters with cylindrical or umbrella elements were associated with the highest reported risk of IVC thrombosis (30-50%). Conical Bard filters were associated with the highest reported risks of fracture (40%). The various FDA-approved IVC filter types were evaluated for device-specific complications based on best current evidence. This information can be used to guide and optimize clinical management in patients with indwelling IVC filters.",

    "Abstract": "Owing to a myriad of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter types and their potential complications, rapid and correct identification may be challenging when encountered on routine imaging. The authors aimed to develop an interactive mobile application that allows recognition of all IVC filters and related complications, to optimize the care of patients with indwelling IVC filters. The FDA Premarket Notification Database was queried from 1980 to 2014 to identify all IVC filter types in the United States. An electronic search was then performed on MEDLINE and the FDA MAUDE database to identify all reported complications associated with each device. High-resolution photos were taken of each filter type and corresponding computed tomographic and fluoroscopic images were obtained from an institutional review board-approved IVC filter registry. A wireframe and storyboard were created, and software was developed using HTML5/CSS compliant code. The software was deployed using PhoneGap (Adobe, San Jose, CA), and the prototype was tested and refined. Twenty-three IVC filter types were identified for inclusion. Safety data from FDA MAUDE and 72 relevant peer-reviewed studies were acquired, and complication rates for each filter type were highlighted in the application. Digital photos, fluoroscopic images, and CT DICOM files were seamlessly incorporated. All data were succinctly organized electronically, and the software was successfully deployed into Android (Google, Mountain View, CA) and iOS (Apple, Cupertino, CA) platforms. A powerful electronic mobile application was successfully created to allow rapid identification of all IVC filter types and related complications. This application may be used to optimize the care of patients with IVC filters.",

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We report on four patients who experienced stem fractures of one design and a review of the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reports on this design. METHODS: Fracture surfaces of four EMPERION™ (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN) femoral stems were analyzed under optical and scanning electron microscopy. A search of the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) that reports on all EMPERION™ adverse events was completed. RESULTS: Fracture surfaces exhibited characteristics consistent with a fatigue fracture mechanism. Sixteen MAUDE reports claimed stem fracture or breakage of EMPERION™ stems. CONCLUSION: The four cases of EMPERION™ stem fractures were likely driven by small stem diameter, high offset, and high patient weight. Modular stem-sleeve femoral systems are susceptible to fatigue failure under high stress and should only be used in appropriate patients, whom are not considered obese.",

    "Title": "A standardized surgical technique for removal of the Interstim tined lead.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Explantation of the Interstim sacral neuromodulation (SNM) device is occasionally necessary. Removing the tined lead can put strain on the lead, resulting in a possible break and retained fragments. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a notification regarding health consequences related to retained lead fragments. We describe a novel and safe surgical technique for removing the Interstim device and permanent lead. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for complications related to tined lead removal and searched the database of a single surgeon at our institution. Our standardized technique for tined lead removal is as follows. An incision is made over the previous lead insertion site and the lead is isolated and externalized. The fibrous encapsulation is dissected off the lead to expose the tines and ensure the lead is free from adhesions. The lead is removed by wrapping it around a curved hemostat and turning it under tension. If the lead breaks, the incision is extended and dissection is carried down to the sacral body to remove all fragments. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had their tined lead removed between 2009 and 2015 after being in place a median of 2.00 years (IQR 1.32-3.32 years). One lead broke (3.6%) during removal over the 6 years using our standardized approach. CONCLUSION: Permanent tined leads can break on removal and retained fragments can pose significant health consequences. Our technique standardizes the approach for removal and is safe and effective in our series.",

    "Title": "Atrioesophageal fistula formation with cryoballoon ablation is most commonly related to the left inferior pulmonary vein.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Collateral damage has been reported with use of the cryoballoon for pulmonary vein isolation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics associated with atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) after cryoballoon use. METHODS: Cases of AEF reported with use of the cryoballoon since 2011 were collected from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, publications, and the manufacturer's database. Lowest balloon temperatures were compared with matched control patients undergoing cryoballoon ablation without AEF formation. Location of AEF was compared with AEF associated with radiofrequency ablation. RESULTS: A total of 11 cases of AEF were identified from a worldwide experience that exceed 120,000 cases. Mean age was 60 (range 31-78 years), and 80% of patients were male. Although mean lowest balloon temperatures were no different between patients with AEF and those with no AEF (-58.5°C ± 7.2°C vs -56°C ± 2.6°C, P = NS), balloon inflation times were longer in patients with AEF (238.8 ± 54.8 seconds vs 178.1 ± 37.5 seconds in the non-AEF group, P ≤.001) All cases of AEF for which location was identified occurred in relation to the left pulmonary veins. The left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) was involved in 8 of 10 patients with cryoballoon compared to 0 of 11 patients in the radiofrequency group (P <.05). Mortality for cryoballoon-associated AEF was 64%. CONCLUSION: AEF after cryoballoon use is rare (<1 in 10,000) and most commonly was identified near the LIPV. Proximity of the esophagus to the LIPV and evidence of esophageal luminal cooling should be considered indications to limit cryoablation at this vein.",

    "Title": "Development of a Classification Scheme for Examining Adverse Events Associated with Medical Devices, Specifically the DaVinci Surgical System as Reported in the FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) database to capture adverse events experienced with the Da Vinci Surgical System. In addition, to design a standardized classification system to categorize the complications and machine failures associated with the device. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Overall, 1,057,000 DaVinci procedures were performed in the United States between 2009 and 2012. Currently, no system exists for classifying and comparing device-related errors and complications with which to evaluate adverse events associated with the Da Vinci Surgical System. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for events reports related to the DaVinci Surgical System between the years 2009 and 2012. A classification system was developed and tested among 14 robotic surgeons to associate a level of severity with each event and its relationship to the DaVinci Surgical System. Events were then classified according to this system and examined by using Chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred thirty-seven events were identified, of which 34% were obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn); 19%, urology; 11%, other; and 36%, not specified. Our classification system had moderate agreement with a Kappa score of 0.52. Using our classification system, we identified 75% of the events as mild, 18% as moderate, 4% as severe, and 3% as life threatening or resulting in death. Seventy-seven percent were classified as definitely related to the device, 15% as possibly related, and 8% as not related. Urology procedures compared with Ob/Gyn were associated with more severe events (38% vs 26%, p < 0.0001). Energy instruments were associated with less severe events compared with the surgical system (8% vs 87%, p < 0.0001). Events that were definitely associated with the device tended to be less severe (81% vs 19%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our classification system is a valid tool with moderate inter-rater agreement that can be used to better understand device-related adverse events. The majority of robotic related events were mild but associated with the device.",

    "Title": "Post-market surveillance to detect adverse events associated with Melody® valve implantation.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe previously unrecognised or under-recognised adverse events associated with Melody® valve implantation. BACKGROUND: In rare diseases and conditions, it is typically not feasible to conduct large-scale safety trials before drug or device approval. Therefore, post-market surveillance mechanisms are necessary to detect rare but potentially serious adverse events. METHODS: We reviewed the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and conducted a structured literature review to evaluate adverse events associated with on- and off-label Melody® valve implantation. Adverse events were compared with those described in the prospective Investigational Device Exemption and Post-Market Approval Melody® transcatheter pulmonary valve trials. RESULTS: We identified 631 adverse events associated with \"on-label\" Melody® valve implants and 84 adverse events associated with \"off-label\" implants. The most frequent \"on-label\" adverse events were similar to those described in the prospective trials including stent fracture (n=210) and endocarditis (n=104). Previously unrecognised or under-recognised adverse events included stent fragment embolisation (n=5), device erosion (n=4), immediate post-implant severe valvar insufficiency (n=2), and late coronary compression (n=2 cases at 5 days and 3 months after implantation). Under-recognised adverse events associated with off-label implantation included early valve failure due to insufficiency when implanted in the tricuspid position (n=7) and embolisation with percutaneous implantation in the mitral position (n=5). CONCLUSION: Post-market passive surveillance does not demonstrate a high frequency of previously unrecognised serious adverse events with \"on-label\" Melody® valve implantation. Further study is needed to evaluate safety of \"off-label\" uses.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of Manufacturer and User Friendly Device Experience (MAUDE) database in studying osseointegrated auditory implant (OAI)-related complications. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for all reports involving OAIs (ie, Baha, Ponto, Sophono). Complications were classified into 1 or more of 6 categories-implant, abutment, processor, skin, surgery, and other. Subcategories were generated to prevent overgeneralization. Other variables recorded included date of report, number of complications per report, manufacturer, and time from complication to report. RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 269 complications listed from 238 reports divided into the following categories: implant related (n = 145), abutment related (n = 16), processor related (n = 13), skin and soft tissue related (n = 79), surgery related (n = 11), and other (n = 5). No demographic data were available. There were no discernible trends from the data, and when compared to published literature, MAUDE data appear to under- or misrepresent complications. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database is limited in its design and given fairly disparate reporting quality may not be ideally suited for quantifying risks of OAIs. These findings suggest the necessity for a substantially improved central registry for otologic implants and highlight the need for further research to investigate the root causes of their associated complication.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Involving Radiation Oncology Medical Devices: Comprehensive Analysis of US Food and Drug Administration Data, 1991 to 2015.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Radiation oncology relies on rapidly evolving technology and highly complex processes. The US Food and Drug Administration collects reports of adverse events related to medical devices. We sought to characterize all events involving radiation oncology devices (RODs) from the US Food and Drug Administration's postmarket surveillance Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, comparing these with non-radiation oncology devices. METHODS AND MATERIALS: MAUDE data on RODs from 1991 to 2015 were sorted into 4 product categories (external beam, brachytherapy, planning systems, and simulation systems) and 5 device problem categories (software, mechanical, electrical, user error, and dose delivery impact). Outcomes included whether the device was evaluated by the manufacturer, adverse event type, remedial action, problem code, device age, and time since 510(k) approval. Descriptive statistics were performed with linear regression of time-series data. Results for RODs were compared with those for other devices by the Pearson χ2 test for categorical data and 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distributions. RESULTS: There were 4234 ROD and 4,985,698 other device adverse event reports. Adverse event reports increased over time, and events involving RODs peaked in 2011. Most ROD reports involved external beam therapy (50.8%), followed by brachytherapy (24.9%) and treatment planning systems (21.6%). The top problem types were software (30.4%), mechanical (20.9%), and user error (20.4%). RODs differed significantly from other devices in each outcome (P<.001). RODs were more likely to be evaluated by the manufacturer after an event (46.9% vs 33.0%) but less likely to be recalled (10.5% vs 37.9%) (P<.001). Device age and time since 510(k) approval were shorter among RODs (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other devices, RODs may experience adverse events sooner after manufacture and market approval. Close postmarket surveillance, improved software design, and manufacturer-user training may help mitigate these events.",

    "Title": "Global Adverse Event Reports of Breast Implant-Associated ALCL: An International Review of 40 Government Authority Databases.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tracking world cases of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is currently limited to patient registries at a few academic centers, dependent upon patient referral and case reports in the literature. The purpose of this study was to review and compare federal database adverse event reports of breast implant-associated ALCL encompassing the major breast implant markets worldwide. METHODS: Federal implantable device regulatory bodies were contacted and database queries were performed for 40 countries. Demographics, device characteristics, pathology, treatment modalities, and outcomes were assessed when available. RESULTS: For the countries queried, 363 unique cases were reported for breast implant-associated ALCL. Search terms \"anaplastic\" and \"ALCL\" were queried of the U.S. Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and yielded 258 unique cases as of September 2015, of which only 130 had pathologic markers performed. Implant surface was textured significantly more than smooth (50 percent versus 4.2 percent; p = 0.0001). Treatment, when reported (n = 136), included explantation [n = 125 (91.9 percent)], chemotherapy [n = 42 (30.8 percent)], radiation therapy [n = 25 (18.4 percent)], and/or stem cell transplant [n = 9 (6.6 percent)], and five deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Federal reporting of breast implant-associated ALCL has limitations in providing clinical history, treatment, and oncologic follow-up. Worldwide and country-specific total and textured implant sales data are needed to determine critical incidence and prevalence analysis. International multi-institutional collaborations and centralized tissue consortiums working in concert with federal authorities are necessary to acquire accurate complete data on breast implant-associated ALCL.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgery with vaginal mesh is often used to treat female urinary incontinence. Questions have emerged over the past decade about the safety and efficacy of vaginal mesh devices. OBJECTIVE: This study examines trends in adverse event reports associated with vaginal mesh devices, testing the hypothesis that Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announcements will result in increased adverse event reports to the FDA. METHODS: Using interrupted time series regression models, we analyzed adverse event report data collected from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience reporting system in 1998 through 2015. RESULTS: FDA announcements had limited effects on the number of adverse event reports, whereas an announcement from a mesh manufacturer that it was withdrawing devices from the market resulted in a large spike in reports. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise concerns about the dispersion of risk communications, the FDA's reliance on adverse event reports for postmarket surveillance, and the FDA's clearance of vaginal mesh without safety or efficacy testing.",

    "Title": "Cortrak-Assisted Feeding Tube Insertion: A Comprehensive Review of Adverse Events in the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic devices to guide feeding tube placement such as the CORTRAK Enteral Access System have shown promising results; however, researchers in recent studies have expressed concern that a higher level of user expertise may be required for safe use. OBJECTIVES: To review adverse events related to CORTRAK-assisted feeding tube insertion reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A retrospective, secondary analysis of the MAUDE database was performed to evaluate adverse events (ie, injury or death of patient) related to CORTRAK. RESULTS: Fifty-four adverse events between January 1, 2006 and February 29, 2016 were identified and reviewed. Most events (98%) involved feeding tube placement in the lungs (37%, left lung; 46%, right lung; 15%, not specified). Lung complications included pneumothorax (77%) and pneumonitis (21%). Death occurred in 17% of lung placements. Clinicians failed to recognize placement in 89% of CORTRAK insertion tracings reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Lung placement is not unique to CORTRAK and is an inherent risk of all feeding tube insertions. In known or suspected lung placement, feeding tubes should be removed and radiography performed to assess for pneumothorax. Clinicians must observe closely for lung placement and discriminate lung from gastric placement on insertion tracings. Clinicians require specialized training and experience to develop competency in using the CORTRAK device, although the exact amount of experience needed is unknown.",

    "Title": "Update on Effectiveness of an Electromagnetic Feeding Tube-Placement Device in Detecting Respiratory Placements.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiography is the accepted gold standard for testing feeding tube placement; however, an electromagnetic tube-placement device (ETPD) is sometimes used in lieu of radiography for this purpose. High success rates have been reported when the device was used by well-trained individuals. However, authors previously described 20 cases that occurred between 2007 and 2012 in which clinicians voluntarily reported inability to detect inadvertent tube insertions in the respiratory tract while using an ETPD. OBJECTIVE: To describe case reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2013 and 2015 regarding inadvertent respiratory placement of feeding tubes by operators using an ETPD. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for cases dated from January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, along with selected brand names. A total of 34 cases (25 after removal of duplicates) were located in which a feeding tube was inserted into the respiratory tract during insertions assisted by an ETPD. RESULTS: Sites of the malpositioned tubes included the right lung (n = 13), left lung (n = 6), unspecified lung (n = 4), and bronchus (n = 2). A pneumothorax occurred in 17 of the 25 misplacements; feedings were administered in 6 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Many case reports involved clinicians failing to recognize tube misplacements in the respiratory tract while using an ETPD. These reports provide evidence that not all clinicians can use the device effectively to detect malpositioned tubes. Thus, one must continue to question the wisdom of eliminating radiographic confirmation of tube position before starting feedings.",

    "Title": "Frequency of pacemaker malfunction associated with monopolar electrosurgery during pulse generator replacement or upgrade surgery.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency of electrosurgery-related pacemaker malfunction. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to investigate electrosurgery-related pacemaker malfunction in consecutive patients undergoing pulse generator (PG) replacement or upgrade from two large hospitals in Minneapolis, MN between January 2011 and January 2014. The occurrence of this pacemaker malfunction was then studied by using MAUDE database for all four major device vendors. RESULTS: A total of 1398 consecutive patients from 2 large tertiary referral centers in Minneapolis, MN undergoing PG replacement or upgrade surgery were retrospectively studied. Four patients (0.3% of all patients), all with pacemakers from St Jude Medical (2.8%, 4 of 142) had output failure or inappropriately low pacing rate below 30 bpm during electrosurgery, despite being programmed in an asynchronous mode. During the same period, 1174 cases of pacemaker malfunctions were reported on the same models in MAUDE database, 37 of which (3.2%) were electrosurgery-related. Twenty-four cases (65%) had output failure or inappropriate low pacing rate. The distribution of adverse events was loss of pacing (59.5%), reversion to backup pacing (32.4%), inappropriate low pacing rate (5.4%), and ventricular fibrillation (2.7%). The majority of these (78.5%) occurred during PG replacement at ERI or upgrade surgery. No electrosurgery-related malfunction was found in MAUDE database on 862 pacemaker malfunction cases during the same period from other vendors. CONCLUSIONS: Electrosurgery during PG replacement or upgrade surgery can trigger output failure or inappropriate low pacing rate in certain models of modern pacemakers. Cautions should be taken for pacemaker-dependent patients.",

    "Title": "Risk of atrioesophageal fistula formation with contact force-sensing catheters.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrioesophageal fistula formation is a rare but life-threatening complication of atrial fibrillation ablation. Contact force (CF)-sensing catheters improve procedural effectiveness. However, the impact of the implementation of CF-sensing technology on the risk of atrioesophageal fistula formation has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the association between the use of CF-sensing catheters and atrioesophageal fistula development. METHODS: We searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for adverse event reports involving Food and Drug Administration-approved ablation catheters. RESULTS: Among 2689 device reports, we identified 78 atrioesophageal fistula cases, 65 of which involved CF-sensing catheters and 13 non-CF-sensing catheters. The percentage of total reports involving atrioeosphageal fistula was 5.4% for CF-sensing catheters (65 of 1202) and 0.9% for non-CF-sensing catheters (13 of 1487) (P < .0001). Procedural details (CF and power settings) were not consistently reported. Esophageal temperature increases were detected in only 2.5% of cases (2 of 78). The mean time to presentation was 16 ± 9 days. Overall mortality was at least 56%, with patients who underwent surgical repair more likely to survive than those treated with stenting or no intervention. CONCLUSION: Atrioesophageal fistula formation accounted for a much higher proportion of reported adverse events with CF-sensing catheters compared with non-CF-sensing catheters. Improved understanding of the relationship between power/force delivery and esophageal damage is needed to minimize the risk of atrioesophageal fistula formation.",

As this innovative treatment for GERD gains widespread use and adoption, an assessment of its safety since U.S. market introduction is presented. METHODS: Events were collected from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, which reports events submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of suspected device-associated deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions. The reporting period was from March 22, 2012 (FDA approval) through May 31, 2016, and included only events occurring in the United States. Additional information was provided by the manufacturer, allowing calculation of implant rates and durations. RESULTS: An estimated 3283 patients underwent magnetic sphincter augmentation (165 surgeons at 191 institutions). The median implant duration was 1.4 years, with 1016 patients implanted for at least 2 years. No deaths, life-threatening events, or device malfunctions were reported. The overall rate of device removal was 2.7% (89/3283). The most common reasons for device removal were dysphagia (52/89) and persistent reflux symptoms (19/89). Removal for erosion and migration was 0.15% (5/3283) and 0% (0/3283), respectively. There were no perforations. Of the device removals, 57.3% (51/89) occurred <1 year after implant, 30.3% (27/89) between 1 and 2 years, and 12.4% (11/89) >2 years after implant. The rate of device removal and erosion with an implant duration >2 years were 1.1% (11/1016) and 0.1% (1/1016), respectively. All device removals and erosions were managed nonemergently, with no complications or long-term consequences. CONCLUSIONS: During a 4-year period in more than 3000 patients, no unanticipated MSAD complications have emerged, and there is no data to suggest a trend of increased events over time. The presentation and management of device-related issues have been less complicated than revisions for laparoscopic fundoplication or other interventions for GERD. MSAD is considered safe for the widespread treatment of GERD.",

    "Title": "Risk management and regulations for lower limb medical exoskeletons: a review.",
    "Abstract": "Gait disability is a major health care problem worldwide. Powered exoskeletons have recently emerged as devices that can enable users with gait disabilities to ambulate in an upright posture, and potentially bring other clinical benefits. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved marketing of the ReWalk™ Personal Exoskeleton as a class II medical device with special controls. Since then, Indego™ and Ekso™ have also received regulatory approval. With similar trends worldwide, this industry is likely to grow rapidly. On the other hand, the regulatory science of powered exoskeletons is still developing. The type and extent of probable risks of these devices are yet to be understood, and industry standards are yet to be developed. To address this gap, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, Clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed databases were searched for reports of adverse events and inclusion and exclusion criteria involving the use of lower limb powered exoskeletons. Current inclusion and exclusion criteria, which can determine probable risks, were found to be diverse. Reported adverse events and identified risks of current devices are also wide-ranging. In light of these findings, current regulations, standards, and regulatory procedures for medical device applications in the USA, Europe, and Japan were also compared. There is a need to raise awareness of probable risks associated with the use of powered exoskeletons and to develop adequate countermeasures, standards, and regulations for these human-machine systems. With appropriate risk mitigation strategies, adequate standards, comprehensive reporting of adverse events, and regulatory oversight, powered exoskeletons may one day allow individuals with gait disabilities to safely and independently ambulate.",

    "Abstract": "With the increasing accuracy of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have come calls for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to label these devices as safe for nonadjunctive dosing of insulin. However, there is evidence that these devices are subject to sporadic, unpredictable, large errors. A text analysis of reports to the FDA MAUDE database since 2015 reveals over 25 000 complaints of CGM sensor inaccuracy, with instances directly leading to serious outcomes. These new data were not considered at a recent FDA Advisory Panel meeting that voted to approve Dexcom G5 relabeling for nonadjunctive use. Social media is another source of surveillance data providing evidence of large CGM inaccuracies in real-world use. We need to improve safety procedures, not remove them. CGMs offer unique information and alerts for managing diabetes, but the issue is not whether they are better than other approaches to monitoring glucose, but how they can be best used in conjunction with devices that offer the confirmatory readings needed for patient safety.",

This decision is expected to reduce the burden of SMBG testing and increase the adoption and persistent use of CGM. The safety of nonadjunctive CGM use was questioned because of sporadic large discrepancies between CGM and SMBG values. These data were viewed in the context of complaints found in the FDA MAUDE database and social media postings.

It is concerned with the safety of medical devices and treatments in the light of understanding the risks and dangers based on the already reported safety issues. Internet resources such as the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) web-site are often retrieved due to the lack of internal, local safety databases. The research looked at how Human Computer Interaction could improve user experience. We have designed data entry for safety reporting and pharmacovigilance based on the web-bases system called WebBISS (Web-based implant search system). The expectation is not only to improve usability, but also to stimulate physicians to enter their safety data and become also contributors, and not only users of information. The expert evaluation has been generally positive and encouraged stronger help and error reporting functions. The high fidelity design has given a good impression of the future mobile solution.",

    "Title": "Stent thrombosis with bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stents: insights from the Food and Drug Administration database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: SYNERGY, a bioabsorbable polymer-based, everolimus-eluting stent (BP-DES), recently received regulatory approval in the USA for use in percutaneous coronary interventions. Yet, information on the safety of BP-DES in routine clinical practice is limited. Our aim was to compare the safety of the recently approved BP-DES with current durable polymer drug-eluting stents (DP-DES) by analyzing adverse events, namely, stent thrombosis (ST), reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database requires nationwide mandatory notification for adverse events on devices approved for clinical use. This database was searched for adverse events reported between 1 October 2015 and 25 December 2016, encountered after the placement of either BP-DES or DP-DES. Only those adverse events were included where the exposure period to the stents was comparable after the index procedure. Of all the adverse events reported, the event of interest was ST. RESULTS: A total of 951 adverse events were reported. ST occurred in 48/951 of all events, 31/309 and 17/642 when BP-DES or DP-DES were used, respectively (P=0.00001). Of the 31 ST events with BP-DES, 68% (21/31) occurred within less than or equal to 24 h of the index procedure and 52% (16/31) occurred within less than or equal to 2 h. CONCLUSION: Our results raise the possibility of an increased risk of ST, particularly early ST (within 24 h), with the recently approved BP-DES. However, because of the inherent limitations of reporting within the MAUDE database, these data merely highlight a potential need for additional surveillance and randomized trials to assess further the safety of the bioabsorbable platform.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To narratively review published information on prevention, detection, pathophysiology, and appropriate treatment of vascular air embolism (VAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Register and Google Scholar databases were searched for data published through October 2016. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for \"air embolism\" reports (years 2011-2016). RESULTS: VAE may be introduced through disruption in the integrity of the venous circulation that occurs during insertion, maintenance, or removal of intravenous or central venous catheters. VAE impacts pulmonary circulation, respiratory and cardiac function, systemic inflammation and coagulation, often with serious or fatal consequences. When VAE enters arterial circulation, air emboli affect cerebral blood flow and the central nervous system. New medical devices remove air from intravenous infusions. Early recognition and treatment reduce the clinical sequelae of VAE. An organized team approach to treatment including clinical simulation can facilitate preparedness for VAE. The MAUDE database included 416 injuries and 95 fatalities from VAE. Data from the American Society of Anesthesiologists Closed Claims Project showed 100% of claims for VAE resulted in a median payment of $325,000. CONCLUSIONS: VAE is an important and underappreciated complication of surgery, anesthesia and medical procedures.",

    "Title": "Device-Related Adverse Events During Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy: Review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is an established technique for removal of large stones from the upper urinary tract. It is a complex multistep procedure requiring several classes of instruments that are subject to operator misuse and device malfunction. We report device-related adverse events during PCNL from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database using a recently developed standardized classification system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for \"percutaneous nephrolithotomy\" from 2006 to 2016. The circumstances and patient complications associated with classes of devices used during PCNL were identified. We then utilized a novel MAUDE classification system to categorize clinical events. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify associations between device classes and severe adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 218 device-related events were reported. The most common classes included: lithotripter 53 (24.3%), wires 43 (19.7%), balloon dilators 30 (13.8%), and occlusion balloons 28 (12.8%). Reported patient complications included need for a second procedure 12 (28.6%), bleeding 8 (19.0%), retained fragments 7 (16.7%), prolonged procedure 4 (9.5%), ureteral injury 2 (4.8%), and conversion to an open procedure 3 (7.1%). Using a MAUDE classification system, 176 complications (81%) were Level I (mild/none), 26 (12%) were Level II (moderate), 15 (7%) were Level III (severe), and 1 (0.5%) was Level IV (life threatening). On univariate analysis, balloon dilators had the highest risk of Level II-IV complications compared with the other device classes [odds ratio: 4.33, confidence interval: 1.978, 9.493, p < 0.001]. The device was evaluated by the manufacturer in 93 (42.7%) cases, with 54.8% of reviewed cases listing the source of malfunction as misuse by the operator. CONCLUSIONS: PCNL is subject to a wide range of device-related adverse events. A MAUDE classification system is useful for standardized, clinically-relevant reporting of events. Our findings highlight the importance of proper surgeon training with devices to maximize efficiency and decrease harm.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is a viable option for AF patients who are unable to tolerate long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC). OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the safety of two commonly used percutaneous devices for LAA closure in the United States by analysis of surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried between May 1, 2006 and May 1, 2016 for LARIAT® (SentreHEART Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) and WATCHMAN™ (Boston Scientific Corp., Marlborough, MA, USA) devices. Among 622 retrieved medical device reports, 356 unique and relevant reports were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of safety events was calculated over the study period and compared between the two devices. RESULTS: LAAC was performed with LARIAT in 4,889 cases. WATCHMAN was implanted in 2,027 patients prior to FDA approval in March 2015 and 3,822 patients postapproval. The composite outcome of stroke/TIA, pericardiocentesis, cardiac surgery, and death occurred more frequently with WATCHMAN (cumulative incidence, 1.93% vs. 1.15%; P = 0.001). The same phenomenon was observed when comparing the WATCHMAN pre- and postapproval experiences for the composite outcome, as well as device embolization, cardiac surgery, and myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: MAUDE-reported data show that postapproval, new technology adoption is fraught with increased complications. Improved collaboration between operators, device manufacturers, and regulators can better serve patients through increased transparency and practical postmarket training and monitoring mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents a software and hardware framework for a telerobotic surgery safety and motor skill training simulator. The aims are at providing trainees a comprehensive simulator for acquiring essential skills to perform telerobotic surgery. Existing commercial robotic surgery simulators lack features for safety training and optimal motion planning, which are critical factors in ensuring patient safety and efficiency in operation. In this work, we propose a hardware-in-the-loop simulator directly introducing these two features. The proposed simulator is built upon the Raven-II™ open source surgical robot, integrated with a physics engine and a safety hazard injection engine. Also, a Fast Marching Tree-based motion planning algorithm is used to help trainee learn the optimal instrument motion patterns. The main contributions of this work are (1) reproducing safety hazards events, related to da Vinci™ system, reported to the FDA MAUDE database, with a novel haptic feedback strategy to provide feedback to the operator when the underlying dynamics differ from the real robot's states so that the operator will be aware and can mitigate the negative impact of the safety-critical events, and (2) using motion planner to generate semioptimal path in an interactive robotic surgery training environment.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to examine adverse clinical events after the use of the Invisalign system and to provide an overview of the actions taken by the manufacturer to address these events. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database of the United States Food and Drug Administration was used. All medical device reports reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration pertaining to products of Align Technology from November 1, 2006, to November 30, 2016, were analyzed. Qualitative content analysis was conducted of event descriptions and manufacturer narrative reports. RESULTS: A total of 173 medical device reports were reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database: 169 (97.7%) were designated as adverse event reports, and 45 (26%) were deemed by the treating doctor to be serious or life threatening. The most medical device reports that reported a serious or life-threatening event were in 2014 (50%). The most frequently reported adverse event was difficulty breathing (56 events) followed by sore throat (35 events), swollen throat (34 events), swollen tongue (31 events), hives and itchiness (31 events), anaphylaxis (30 events), swollen lips (27 events), and feeling of throat closing/tight airway/airway obstruction/laryngospasm (24 events). CONCLUSIONS: Serious or life-threatening events could be associated with use of Invisalign systems. Health care providers should be aware of these events and know how to handle them if they arise in their practices.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Reported Balloon Malfunctions and Proposed Rescue Strategy for Malfunction during Airway Dilation.",
    "Abstract": "Objective The rate of balloon dilator failure is unknown, and a rescue strategy for device malfunction has not been established. The purposes of this investigation were to determine the approximate number of balloon failures in the gastrointestinal tract and airway, evaluate the parameters required to rupture balloon dilators, and develop a rescue strategy to efficiently reestablish airway patency. Study Design Retrospective cohort and basic medical research. Setting Academic tertiary care medical center. Subjects and Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for adverse events associated with tracheal and esophageal dilators between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2017. A bench-top model of airway stenosis was developed, and optimal conditions for the safe removal of a malfunctioning dilator were assessed (2, 4, 6 atm). Results There were 420 reported balloon malfunctions, including 104 cases with deflation/removal issues. The bench-top model determined that device rupture allowing for immediate removal occurs with needle puncture at balloon pressures ≥8 atm. Balloons inflated to 6 atm required a median of 17.5 seconds (range, 0-55.3) for removal, in comparison with 30.2 seconds (range, 7.1-87.5) at 2 atm ( P > .05). Conclusion Balloon dilator malfunction is a significant problem that practitioners must be prepared for. Pressure ≥8 atm (~33% overinflation) is required to consistently cause complete balloon dilator rupture via needle puncture. While counterintuitive, increasing the inflation pressure of a malfunctioning balloon (8-10 atm) may expedite rupture and safe removal. A rescue strategy for balloon malfunction is proposed.",

    "Title": "A Cross-sectional Analysis of Adverse Events and Litigation for Injectable Fillers.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Injectable fillers are increasing in popularity as a noninvasive option to address concerns related to facial aging and volume loss. To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale analyses of adverse events and associated litigation related to filler injections. OBJECTIVES: To determine risks of injectable fillers and analyze factors raised in litigation related to injectable fillers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional review, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database was evaluated for complications from the use of the following fillers: Juvederm, Restylane, Belotero, Sculptra, Radiesse, Artefill, Bellafill, and Juvederm Voluma from 2014 to 2016. The Westlaw Next database was used to identify jury verdicts. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications were organized by type of filler used, location of injection, and severity. Intra-arterial injections without sequelae and those resulting in blindness or necrosis were considered severe complications. Factors raised during the litigation process were also analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1748 adverse events analyzed, most cases stemmed from cheek (751 [43.0%]) or lip (524 [30.0%]) injection. Commonly reported adverse events reported included swelling (755 [43.2%]) and infection (725 [41.5%]). Among FDA-reported complications, blindness was significantly associated with dorsal nasal injections (P < .001). Vascular compromise with and without sequela of dermal necrosis and blindness were significantly associated with Radiesse injections P < .001. Of the 9 malpractice cases identified, two-thirds involved allegations of inadequate informed consent, and the median award in cases resolved with payment was $262 000. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although specific complication profiles vary by material and injection site, common adverse events associated with injectable fillers include swelling and infection. More serious events include vascular compromise, resulting in necrosis and blindness; these events are also raised in cases involving litigation. This analysis illustrates the importance of outlining these risks in a comprehensive preoperative informed consent process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.",

    "Abstract": "Health information technology (HIT) events, a subtype of patient safety events, pose a major threat and barrier toward a safer healthcare system. It is crucial to gain a better understanding of the nature of the errors and adverse events caused by current HIT systems. The scarcity of HIT event-exclusive databases and event reporting systems indicates the challenge of identifying the HIT events from existing resources. FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a potential resource for HIT events. However, the low proportion and the rapid evolvement of HIT-related events present challenges for distinguishing them from other equipment failures and hazards. We proposed a strategy to identify and synchronize HIT events from MAUDE by using a filter based on structured features and classifiers based on unstructured features. The strategy will help us develop and grow an HIT event-exclusive database, keeping pace with updates to MAUDE toward shared learning.",

    "Title": "Investigating Complications Associated With Occipital Nerve Stimulation: A MAUDE Study.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to utilize the MAUDE data base to enhance our understanding of the complication profile for Occipital Nerve Stimulation, a therapy for which the current level of evidence is limited. Additionally, it is our objective to describe a systematic approach to processing the MAUDE data, which addresses its flaws and enhances its utility. METHODS: From the FDA website, we accessed adverse events reports from the MAUDE data base for devices used in Occipital Nerve Stimulation between June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2017. All reports were sorted into an overall classification for types of adverse events, types of patient complaints, and types of specific device-related complications. We then evaluated for the total number of adverse event reports that contained each of the patient complains and device-related complications. RESULTS: A total of 1233 adverse event records were obtained. Eight hundred twenty-two records were classified as surgically manageable post-operative complications, 121 as device malfunction, 29 as patient compliance issues, and 27 as intra-operative complications. Two hundred thirty-seven records were not classified. A total of 683 records contained patient complaints including 467 complaints of ineffective stimulation, 122 complaints of inappropriate or over-stimulation, 50 complaints of device-shock, and 44 complaints of IPG site pain. We found 581 post-operative device-related complications, which included 206 instances of lead migration, 157 reports of lead erosion, 155 infections, 46 lead-fractures, and 17 lead disconnections. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE data base is a useful tool to investigate device related complications and helps fill the current gap in ONS data. Reviewing the types and frequencies of complications reported over the years allows clinicians with less personal experience to have a more realistic expectation of complications and make informed decisions based on the patient's unique needs. Additionally, patient complaint data are useful in establishing more realistic expectations for patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Facial implants represent an important strategy for providing instant and long-lasting volume enhancement to address both aging and posttraumatic defects. OBJECTIVE: To better understand risks of facial implants by examining national resources encompassing adverse events and considerations facilitating associated litigation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study reviewed complications following facial implants. The procedures reviewed were performed on patients at locations throughout the United States from January 2006 to December 2016. Data collection was completed in March 2017. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, which contains medical device reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was searched for complications that occurred from January 2006 to December 2016 involving facial implants made by Implantech, MEDPOR, Stryker, KLS Martin, and Synthes. Furthermore, the Thomson Reuters Westlaw legal database was searched for relevant litigation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The complications of facial implants were analyzed in relation to the location of implant and severity of complication. Litigation was analyzed to determine which factors determine outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-nine instances of adverse events reported to the FDA were identified. Sixteen (41%) involved malar implants, followed by 12 chin implants (31%). The most common complications included infection (18 [46%]), implant migration (9 [23%]), swelling (7 [18%]), and extrusion (4 [10%]). Thirty-two patients (83%) had to have their implants removed. Infection occurred at a mean (SD) of 83.3 (68.8) days following the surgery. One-third of complications involved either migration or extrusion. The mean (range) time to migration or extrusion was 381.1 (10-2400) days. In 12 malpractice cases identified in publicly available court proceedings, alleged inadequate informed consent and requiring additional surgical intervention (ie, removal) were the most commonly cited factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Infection and implant migration or extrusion are the most common complications of facial implants. Most of these complications necessitate removal. These considerations need to be discussed with patients preoperatively as part of the informed consent process, as allegedly inadequate informed consent was cited in a significant proportion of resultant litigation, and there were overlapping considerations among adverse events reported to the FDA and factors brought up in relevant litigation. Cases resolved with settlements and jury-awarded damages encompassed considerable award totals. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.",

    "Abstract": "We analyzed the adverse events associated with an off-label use of arterial stents and CE-marked iliac vein stents for the treatment of iliac venous thromboembolism and investigated their relationships with the anatomical features of the iliac vein, to gain insights into the development of a better iliac vein stent. Reports of adverse events following the use of stents in the iliac vein were retrieved from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database that contain suspected device-associated complications reported to the Food and Drug Administration. Data from 2006 to 2016 were investigated. The literature analysis was also conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science focusing on English articles published up to 4 October 2016. The analysis of 88 adverse events from the MAUDE database and 182 articles from the literature revealed that a higher number of adverse events had been reported following the use of arterial stents in the iliac vein compared to CE-marked iliac vein stents. While stent migration and shortening were reported only for the arterial stents, stent fracture and compression occurred regardless of the stent type, even though a vein does not pulsate. A study of the anatomical features of the iliac vein implies that bending, compression, and kink loads are applied to the iliac vein stents in vivo. For designing, developing, and pre-clinical testing of stents intended for use in the iliac vein, the above mechanical load environments induced by the anatomical features should be considered.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to determine the characteristics, magnitude, and the quality of reporting of mandated events involving intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) devices in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database; a postmarket surveillance system. METHODS: We utilized a mixed-methods approach to systematically characterize structured data and text narratives associated with IV-PCA events submitted to MAUDE between 1 January 2011 and 12 September 2016. RESULTS: Of 1,430 IV-PCA events reported during the study period, 6.4% were adverse events (AEs) as identified via structured data fields in the MEDWATCH forms. Upon qualitative review of the narrative texts, 11.0% of events were associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome, which was 71% higher than the incidence of the adverse outcomes reported using the structured data fields. Device-related issues, which were mostly preventable, accounted for 86.9% of events. Of 65 reportable events submitted by manufacturers, 18.5% did not comply with reporting requirements as mandated by law. CONCLUSION: Patients on IV-PCA continue to experience serious complications as a result of preventable errors. Multi-modal interventions including educational training and the development and adoption of PCA devices with improved safety features are needed to improve safety.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the utility of the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in objectively capturing adverse events for transvaginal mesh in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 1,103 individual medical device reports submitted to the MAUDE database that inspired the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration's 2008 Public Health Notification. Entries were compiled into a categorical database that reported manufacturer, brand, reporter type, report source, and type of adverse event. RESULTS: There were numerous examples of missing, duplicated, and non-standardized entries. Analysis revealed 64 reports with duplicated information, and six reports representing multiple patients. Forty-seven percent of medical device reports did not identify a reporter source. At least 28% of reported devices are no longer on the US market. There was wide variability in the quality and completeness of submitted reports and true adverse event rates could not be accurately calculated because the number of total cases was unknown. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database was limited in its ability to collect, quantify, and standardize real-life adverse events related to transvaginal mesh. While it functions to collect information related to isolated adverse events, systematic limitations of the MAUDE database, that no doubt extend to other medical devices, necessitate the development of new reporting systems. Alternatives are under development, which may allow regulators to more accurately scrutinize the safety profiles of specific medical devices.",

    "Title": "Comparison of adverse event and device problem rates for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and Mitraclip procedures as reported by the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry and the Food and Drug Administration postmarket surveillance data.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although outcomes data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter mitral valve repair (Mitraclip) are available via the Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) registry, dissemination of TVT data is often delayed. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) system collects postmarket outcomes data in public medical device reports. We used natural language processing to compare the event rates for TAVR and Mitraclip in the TVT registry and from MAUDE data. METHODS: We identified all medical device reports related to TAVR and Mitraclip from December 2011 through December 2014. Our primary objective was to demonstrate that event rates in TVT and MAUDE were not significantly different. We also compared TVT event rates for TAVRs performed in 2014 to MAUDE-derived event rates for the Sapien XT and CoreValve devices, both Food and Drug Administration-approved in 2014. RESULTS: Regression analysis demonstrated close correlation between TVT and MAUDE rates for both TAVR and Mitraclip, with R2 values of 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. The rates for all events except bleeding were not statistically significantly different. We demonstrated similar increased rates of permanent pacemaker implantation in the 2014 TVT and MAUDE data sets consistent with approval of the CoreValve. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that natural language processing technology sorted through raw MAUDE data, allowing identification of the most common events associated with TAVR and Mitraclip procedures, and that MAUDE-derived event rates were not statistically significantly different from TVT event rates. This technology has important public health implications because it improves postmarket surveillance of implantable devices and permits rapid and early dissemination of vital information.",

    "Title": "Worldwide Experience with Erosion of the Magnetic Sphincter Augmentation Device.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The magnetic sphincter augmentation device continues to become a more common antireflux surgical option with low complication rates. Erosion into the esophagus is an important complication to recognize and is reported to occur at very low incidences (0.1-0.15%). Characterization of this complication remains limited. We aim to describe the worldwide experience with erosion of the magnetic sphincter augmentation device including presentation, techniques for removal, and possible risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data obtained from the device manufacturer Torax Medical, Inc., as well as the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The study period was from February 2007 through July 2017 and included all devices placed worldwide. RESULTS: In total, 9453 devices were placed and there were 29 reported cases of erosions. The median time to presentation of an erosion was 26 months with most occurring between 1 and 4 years after placement. The risk of erosion was 0.3% at 4 years after device implantation. Most patients experienced new-onset dysphagia prompting evaluation. Devices were successfully removed in all patients most commonly via an endoscopic removal of the eroded portion followed by a delayed laparoscopic removal of the remaining beads. At a median follow-up of 58 days post-removal, there were no complications and 24 patients have returned to baseline. Four patients reported ongoing mild dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: Erosion of the LINX device is an important but rare complication to recognize that has been safely managed via minimally invasive approaches without long-term consequences.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most of the literature on shoulder arthroplasty failure comes from high-volume centers. These reports tend to exclude the experience of community orthopedic surgeons, who perform most of the shoulder joint replacements. METHODS: We analyzed the failure reports mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration for all hospitals. Each reported event from 2012 to 2016 was characterized by implant, failure mode, and year of surgery. RESULTS: For the 1673 anatomic arthroplasties, the most common failure modes were glenoid component failure (20.4%), rotator cuff/subscapularis tear (15.4%), pain/stiffness (12.9%), dislocation/instability (11.8%), infection (9%), and humeral component loosening (5.1%). For the 2390 reverse arthroplasties, the most common failure modes were dislocation/instability (32%), infection (13.8%), glenosphere-baseplate dissociation (12.2%), failed/loosened baseplate (10.4%), humeral component dissociation/tray fracture (5.5%), difficulty inserting the baseplate (4.8%), and difficulty inserting the glenosphere (4.2%). Although the percentage distribution among the different failure modes was relatively consistent over the years of this study, the percentage distribution of these failure modes differed substantially among different implant manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: The Food and Drug Administration database reveals modes of shoulder arthroplasty failure that are not emphasized in the published literature, such as rotator cuff tear, infection, and postoperative pain/stiffness for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty and implant dissociation and baseplate failure for reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Knowledge of these failure modes may help inform surgical technique and implant design in ways that will lower the risk of implant failure in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Health information technology (HIT) events were listed in the top 10 technology-related hazards since one in six patient safety events (PSE) is related to HIT. Although it becomes a common sense that event reporting is an effective way to accumulate typical cases for learning, the lack of HIT event databases remains a challenge. Aiming to retrieve HIT events from millions of event reports related to medical devices in FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, we proposed a novel identification strategy composed of a structured data-based filter and an unstructured data-based classifier using both TF-IDF and biterm topic. A dataset with 97% HIT events was retrieved from the raw database of 2015 FDA MAUDE, which contains approximately 0.4~0.9% HIT events. This strategy holds promise of initializing and growing an HIT database to meet the challenges of collecting, analyzing, sharing, and learning from HIT events at an aggregated level.",

    "Abstract": "To facilitate preventing patient safety events, researchers have been using the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Device Experience (MAUDE) database as a publicly accessible data source for retrieving reports of medical devices including Health Information Technology (HIT) devices. A combined search strategy built with keywords in several fields such as Generic Name, Brand Name and Manufacturer is commonly used to extract reports of specific classifications of devices in the MAUDE. However, another structured field, Classification Product Code, is rarely visited. To improve the secondary usage of the MAUDE database in retrieval of HIT events, we extracted HIT reports from a nine-year MAUDE dataset by combining keywords filter and expert review, and explored Classification Product Codes. The distributions and relationships between Product Codes and keywords in Generic Name/Manufacturer in HIT reports were visualized to provide a view of the landscape. This study presents a new perspective for improving the search strategy of HIT events in MAUDEwhich would facilitate the understanding of HIT events for improving patient safety.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orogastric tubes have traditionally aided foregut procedures with sizing and organ protection. The rise of bariatric surgery has led to the creation of novel medical devices aimed at facilitating the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. While approved by the FDA, the long-term safety profile of these devices in the general population is often unknown. This review looks at complications associated with novel Orogastric Tubes compared to the traditional bougie. METHODS: We performed a review of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for complications associated with the traditional bougie, Boehringer Labs ViSiGi 3D® and the Medtronic GastriSail™ since 2011. In addition, we looked for reported cases in the literature of complications with these devices. RESULTS: Overall complication rates reported in the MAUDE database varied in number and severity. The bougie had seven reported complications, one of which was an organ perforation. The ViSiGi 3D® had zero reported complications. The GastriSail™ had 36 total reported complications with 17 perforations. A literature review shows that rates of bougie complications are extremely rare with no case reports or reviews of complications from the novel orogastric tubes. CONCLUSIONS: The complication rates between the traditional bougie and novel devices vary in number and severity, with the GastriSail™ having the highest reported complication rate. Despite rigorous testing for FDA approval, ongoing research into performance of new medical devices in the general population remains important.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a publicly available resource providing over 4 million records relating to medical device safety. Using downloadable MAUDE files avoids limitations of the online MAUDE search interface. However, naive file usage can result in errors, while independent discovery of the nuances required to correctly work with the database can be time-consuming. Practical information is provided to shorten this learning curve and obtain accurate results when using the MAUDE database files. MAUDE FILE DESCRIPTIONS: The MAUDE database consists of 135 fields in four primary (Master Event, Device, Patient, Text) and two supplemental (Device Problems and Problem Code Descriptions) file types. When combined, these six files provide a detailed account of an adverse event or product problem report. Website instructions for joining the files are incomplete. Comprehensive details are provided to enable precise file linking. LESSONS LEARNED: MAUDE files have irregularities that must be understood to download and work with the data efficiently. Accurate results depend upon combining the files correctly and understanding the difference between report and event denominators. Appreciating data availability can facilitate successful MAUDE investigations. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database can provide key insights about medical device safety. Detailed information is provided about the structure, content and interrelationships of the MAUDE database files to enable investigators to use this valuable resource more quickly and accurately.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To analyze and investigate reports associated with uterine artery embolization used for treatment of myomas using this database. DESIGN: A retrospective review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for events related to uterine artery embolization (Canadian Task Force Classification III). SETTING: The MAUDE database was accessed online. PATIENTS: Patients with myomas undergoing uterine artery embolization. INTERVENTIONS: The MAUDE database was accessed online and searched for events related to uterine artery embolization reported between 1998 and 2018. These reports were reviewed and analyzed, reported events were categorized, and other relevant information was collected and tabulated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 193 reports published during the study period were identified. Pain was the most frequently reported event (68 events; 35.2%), followed by vaginal discharge (45 events; 23.3%), operational misfire (37 events; 19.2%), and fever or infectious complications (36 events; 18.7%). A surgical procedure was required in 27 events (14.0%), with hysterectomy reported in 7.8% of the events. Death following this procedure was mentioned in 5 events (2.6%). CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database may be useful for clinicians using a Food and Drug Administration-approved medical device to identify the occurrence of adverse events and complications. A variety of adverse events associated with the use of uterine artery embolization were reported to the MAUDE database related to its use in the treatment of uterine myomas. We encourage physicians to review the MAUDE database when using medical devices, because this is an important tool to assess uncommon but major problems that could be associated with a medical device.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to determine whether systemic cobalt toxicity as an adverse event could be documented using the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cobalt-chromium containing hip implant recipients. Class 3 Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/DePuy devices were chosen for analysis because of the large number of adverse event reports related to their Pinnacle and ASR XL Acetabular hip replacement systems. A secondary goal was to characterize the reporters who are populating the information in the MAUDE database and to evaluate the quality of the data and information submitted. METHODS: Using FDA MAUDE downloadable data files, 83,528 adverse event medical device narrative reports were identified with the product code of KWA (Prosthesis, Hip, Semiconstrained [Metal Uncemented Acetabular Component]) for J&J/DePuy (KWA Text File). These are class 3 devices and devices with known high failure rates. The ASR XL Acetabular hip replacement Systems and Pinnacle fall into this category. This group of implants was chosen because implant failure is associated with elevated cobalt levels. Two additional subfiles were created from Free Text records in the narrative reports containing key words that indicated a chromium or cobalt (CrCo) device and another for key words indicating elevated levels of cobalt or toxicity. These files were then searched for symptoms of systemic cobalt toxicity with Microsoft Excel using key words pertaining to symptom categories of: cognitive/memory loss, tremor, neuropathy, depression, auditory symptoms, visual symptoms, cardiac, and thyroid disease. Reports are submitted to the FDA at the device component level. It was common for multiple reports to be submitted for a single device. RESULTS: It was not possible to differentiate systemic versus local symptoms for adverse event reports in the neuropathy category. This category was not analyzed. The number of adverse event reports in the other categories ranged from 119 to 16 for the J&J/DePuy KWA Text File and 59 to 4 in the file of records having key words indicating potential elevation of CrCo or toxicity. Cardiac, visual, and auditory conditions were most frequently reported. With the possible exception of cardiomyopathy, the numbers of these reports are far below the prevalence expected in the general population of comparable age. The content of the MAUDE database records often contained little objective data. We found less than 4% of 14,714 records, which indicated cobalt elevation or toxicity contained units for quantitative measurement. There was also frequent use of nondescript, all-encompassing words and phrases such as \"mental anguish,\" found in 321 KWA Text File records. Manufacturers submitted more than 99% of the reports and the most common reporter occupation was attorney, found in 42.24% of the 83,550 J&J/DePuy KWA Reporter File records. Physician was the reporter's occupation in 20.48% of reports but seldom reported directly to the FDA. CONCLUSIONS: We were not able find in the FDA MAUDE database meaningful warning signs to support the contention that chromium-cobalt-containing Class 3 J&J and DePuy hip implants caused systemic neurological or thyroid symptoms in patients. The incidence of reported cardiomyopathy was rare but frequent enough to be cause of concern. The redaction of most patient data along with the nonstructured nature of data entry would be expected to hinder the identification of warning signs. Even identification of the type of device could not be consistently carried out. In addition, the FDA needs to implement a methodology to identify and group all reports from a single device implanted into a patient, so duplication of event counting would not occur. Of 83,550 J&J/DePuy KWA Reporter File records, we found only two physician reports sent directly to the FDA. Almost all reports are submitted by manufacturers and are most commonly authored by attorneys. A standard of care needs to be set for physicians to report medical device adverse events to the FDA.",

    "Title": "Why the Details of Glucose Meter Evaluations Matters.",
    "Abstract": "In an article in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Macleod and coworkers describe an evaluation of LifeScan glucose meters that focus on the effects of sample types and comparison methods. They make a valid point that these factors influence the accuracy observed in evaluations and recommend the comparison method be the one recommended by the manufacturer for the sample type in the intended use statement. Yet, the recommended comparison method is not a reference method. The accuracy hierarchy of definitive, reference, and field methods originally described by Tietz should remind one that virtually all glucose meter evaluations use commercially available field methods as the comparison method. Finally, one should not neglect the FDA adverse event database as a way to assess glucose meter performance.",

    "Title": "Guidewire fracture during orbital atherectomy for peripheral artery disease: Insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Orbital atherectomy (OA) is routinely being used for plaque modification to facilitate percutaneous revascularization in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and arterial calcification. Guidewire fracture (GWF) during OA, though anecdotally described, has not been studied in a systematic manner. We conducted a review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to study the reports of wire fracture and its management and consequences. METHODS: We queried the MAUDE database for all events involving the current generation of the OA device: \"Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System\", and \"Stealth 360° Orbital PAD System\". RESULTS: We identified 62 reports of GWF during OA for PAD. The superficial femoral artery was the most commonly involved atherectomy site. The wire fractured at the soft tip in a majority of cases (68%). Embolized wire fragments were left in the patient in 36 cases (58%), retrieved percutaneously in 10 cases (16%), and trapped by a stent against the arterial wall in eight cases (13%). Lastly, eight patients (13%) underwent surgery for removal of the wire fragment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published report to study the complication of GWF during peripheral OA. GWF is an uncommon but has significant procedural and clinical consequences. It results in a high rate of ancillary rescue procedures (including surgery) and is associated with a higher risk of arterial thrombosis and complications from wire retrieval attempts. The risk of wire fracture may be avoided with carefully adherence to the IFU.",

    "Title": "Biliary and pancreatic lithotripsy devices.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lithotripsy is a procedure for fragmentation or destruction of stones to facilitate their removal or passage from the biliary or pancreatic ducts. Although most stones may be removed endoscopically using conventional techniques such as endoscopic sphincterotomy in combination with balloon or basket extraction, lithotripsy may be required for clearance of large, impacted, or irregularly shaped stones. Several modalities have been described, including intracorporeal techniques such as mechanical lithotripsy (ML), electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), and laser lithotripsy, as well as extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). METHODS: In this document, we review devices and methods for biliary and pancreatic lithotripsy and the evidence regarding efficacy, safety, and financial considerations. RESULTS: Although many difficult stones can be safely removed using ML, endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) has emerged as an alternative that may lessen the need for ML and also reduce the rate of adverse events. EHL and laser lithotripsy are effective at ductal clearance when conventional techniques are unsuccessful, although they usually require direct visualization of the stone by the use of cholangiopancreatoscopy and are often limited to referral centers. ESWL is effective but often requires coordination with urologists and the placement of stents or drains with subsequent procedures for extracting stone fragments and, thus, may be associated with increased costs. CONCLUSIONS: Several lithotripsy techniques have been described that vary with respect to ease of use, generalizability, and cost. Overall, lithotripsy is a safe and effective treatment for difficult biliary and pancreatic duct stones.",

    "Title": "Timely recognition of total elbow and radial head arthroplasty adverse events: an analysis of reports to the US Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent recalls of several commonly used elbow arthroplasty implants have prompted interest in the modes by which elbow implants fail and the timing of reports of these failures. METHODS: We reviewed the adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2012 to 2015 regarding elbow arthroplasty to determine the event date and the type of each adverse event. RESULTS: Among 179 total elbow adverse event reports, the most common modes of failure were implant dissociation (23%), loosening (22%), and infection (16%). The most common modes of failure among 58 radial head replacement reports were component dissociation (19%) and linkage screw failure (19%). The percentage distribution of adverse event types differed among different arthroplasty systems and from that reported in published reviews of elbow arthroplasty. Three implant recalls were implemented 2, 5, and 9 years after the first adverse event report in the MAUDE database. For 2 of the recalls, the first reports of the device failures were published 2 and 5 years after the first MAUDE reports. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database is a publicly funded and publicly available means by which surgeons can identify adverse events for the prostheses they use before such information becomes available through journal publication or recall notification. In this study, MAUDE data revealed a higher relative frequency of mechanical dissociation of elbow implants than what has been represented in the literature. Early identification of these adverse events may help surgeons by informing their implant selection and surgical technique.",

    "Abstract": "Glucose meter evaluations are common and provide important information about glucose meter performance versus standards. Although some meters meet guidelines and others fall short in these evaluations, most results are within the A and B zones of a glucose meter error grid. Another data source that is seldom used is the FDA adverse event database (MAUDE). This database describes glucose meter malfunctions and injury as reported by actual users and returned 10 837 adverse events across all meters for the first 7 months of 2018. Reliability growth management is an established tool to reduce failure rates. A reliability growth example is presented followed by a discussion of how this tool could be applied to reduce glucose meter failure events using the MAUDE database.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Greater demand for noninvasive techniques to reduce cellulite and contour the body has led to the growth of electromagnetic and radiofrequency devices. In this study, we aimed to characterize the evolution and safety of electromagnetic devices marketed in the U.S. over the last two decades. Methods: We examined records from a U.S. FDA database documenting premarket approval of electromagnetic devices between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2018. Additionally, we searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reports of adverse events. Results: Thirty-one devices were approved from 2012-2018. Initially marketed to temporarily reduce muscle pain and cellulite, indications for these devices have expanded. The MAUDE database revealed 61 reports of adverse events including acute skin damage, dyspigmentation, infection, hair growth, scarring, and others. Discussion: Although electromagnetic devices are gaining increasing public attention and marketed to be safe, the frequency and types of adverse events are not well-documented. Importantly, the MAUDE database has limitations including submission of incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, or unverified data make determining the true number of adverse events difficult. Further investigation is greatly needed to define appropriate parameters and outcomes for the use of electromagnetic devices in body contouring and skin enhancement.",

    "Title": "Robotic sacrocolpopexy: adverse events reported to the FDA over the last decade.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: As surgeons increase the volume of robotic abdominal sacrocolpopexies (rASCs) and become more experienced, a subsequent decrease in the number of adverse events is expected over time. Further, as the leading manufacturer of the operative robot (Intuitive Surgical) improves the technology, adverse events should also decrease. We hypothesized that there has been a decrease in adverse event reporting for rASCs and that serious adverse events are rare. METHODS: We performed a search of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. All entries with the manufacturer \"Intuitive Surgical\" were exported from 2007 to 2017. All entries with \"sacrocolpopexy\" were then isolated and analyzed. RESULTS: The number of adverse events reported for rASC peaked in 2013 and 2014, at 107 and 124 respectively. In 2015 and 2016, the number dropped to 11 and 7 respectively. There were 334 reported adverse events from 2007 to 2017. Five (1.50%) were categorized as death, 33 (9.88%) as injury, and 296 (88.62%) as malfunction. Analysis of the malfunction reports found that 15 out of 296 (5.07%) were converted to open surgery, 4 out of 296 (1.3%) were converted to laparoscopic surgery, 4 out of 296 (1.3%) cases were aborted, and 6 out of 296 (2.03%) malfunctions resulted in patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MAUDE database has its limitations, it does indicate that the number of adverse events reported for rASC peaked in 2013 and 2014 and has decreased annually since then. This may be due to improved proficiency of the surgeon and surgical team, in addition to improvements in the robot. When malfunctions do occur, they infrequently cause serious injury or have an impact on surgical approach.",

    "Title": "Retrospective analysis of complications associated with dorsal root ganglion stimulation for pain relief in the FDA MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dorsal root ganglion stimulation is an emerging therapy in the treatment of chronic pain. Compared with traditional spinal cord stimulation, it allows a discretely targeted stimulation profile and may act via differing mechanisms of action. Despite these advantages, little is known about the complications associated with this new modality. METHODS: We queried the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database for all entries named 'Dorsal root ganglion stimulator for pain relief' reported between May 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. We verified these data through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the US Food and Drug Administration. We then eliminated duplicate entries and categorized each complication based on the event description. A secondary analysis was performed to characterize the serious adverse events and the severity of new neurologic symptoms and infections. RESULTS: We identified 979 unique episodes following our process of deduplication. Almost half (47%) of entries were categorized as device-related complications, a quarter (28%) as procedural complications, with the remainder as patient complaints (12%), serious adverse events (2.4%), and 'other' complications (4.6%). The majority of complications were managed surgically with revision (n = 488; 49.8%) rather than explant (n = 161; 16.4%) events, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 'Dorsal root ganglion stimulator for pain relief' device has been publicized as a breakthrough in neuromodulation technologies. As with any new technology, we must proceed with caution and re-evaluate effectiveness as information becomes available. The MAUDE database has provided safety data unique for this device that will aid in informed consent and further refinement of this innovative therapy.",

    "Title": "Internal insulation breaches in an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead with redundant conductors.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internal insulation breaches (IBR) may result in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead failure and adverse clinical events. Concerns exist that the Durata lead may be prone to IBR. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess Durata failures in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and compare them to failures in MAUDE for Endotak Reliance and Sprint Quattro Secure (QS) leads. METHODS: We searched the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2018 for IBR and other failure modes. Included were explanted leads whose manufacturers found an insulation or conductor defect not caused by extrinsic factors. RESULTS: The MAUDE search found 1011 qualifying leads. The cause of failure differed among leads (P < .001). The primary cause of Durata failure was IBR (293 of 316 leads [93%]), with IBR accounting for 47% (137 of 293); few QS (9 of 523 [1.7%]) and no Endotak Reliance leads failed because of IBR (P < .001). Durata IBR were responsible for 11 failures to treat ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, and all were caused by high-voltage (HV) shorts between the proximal superior vena cava coil and a distal right ventricular coil cable (n = 10) or sensing conductor (n = 1); low values of HV impedance were found in these leads during defibrillation threshold testing (n = 3), after a shock or aborted shock (n = 7), and by an alert (n = 1). Inappropriate therapy was caused by 51 Durata IBR, but no QS IBR. CONCLUSION: Durata implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads are susceptible to IBR that may result in failure to treat ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or inappropriate therapy; such failures may occur without forewarning. HV testing of Durata leads may be indicated during pulse generator replacement or when an insulation defect is suspected.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Powered muscle stimulators have been popularized in recent years due to their muscle toning effects. This study aims to describe marketing trends and reporting of adverse effects of powered muscle stimulators.Methods: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of records from the United States FDA database for 510(k) premarket approval of powered muscle stimulators between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2018. The FDA MAUDE database was reviewed for adverse events reported with device usage.Results: One hundred and seventeen devices received 510(k) premarket approval between 2000 and 2018, with the first approval occurring in 2001. Initially, devices were marketed to assist with muscle toning and strengthening, but more recent indications include the treatment of pain, increased local muscle blood circulation, and prevention of post-surgical venous thrombosis. Thirty-six adverse event reports have been submitted and published in the MAUDE database over the past 10 years by 11% of manufacturers.Discussion: Powered muscle stimulators are growing increasingly popular amongst consumers and healthcare providers due to their ease of use and perceived esthetic, muscle strength, and pain relief benefits. Additional investigation to determine optimal treatment parameters and potential adverse effects is necessary due to the growing popularity of these devices.",

    "Title": "Understanding Health Information Technology Induced Medication Safety Events by Two Conceptual Frameworks.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: While health information technology (health IT) is able to prevent medication errors in many ways, it may also potentially introduce new paths to errors. To understand the impact of health IT induced medication errors, this study aims to conduct a retrospective analysis of medication safety reports. METHODS: From the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, we identified reports in which health IT is a contributing factor to medication errors. We applied two conceptual frameworks, Sittig and Singh's sociotechnical model and Coiera's information value chain, to examine the identified reports. RESULTS: We identified 152 unique reports on health IT induced medication errors as the final report set for review. The majority (65.13%) of the reports involved multiple contributing factors according to the sociotechnical model. Three dimensions, that is, clinical content, human-computer interface, and people, were involved in more reports than the others. The transition of the effects of health IT on medication practice was summarized using information value chain. Health IT related contributing factors may lead to receiving wrong information, missing information, receiving partial information and delayed information, and receiving wrong information and missing information tend to cause the commission errors in decision-making. CONCLUSION: The two frameworks provide an opportunity to understand a comprehensive context of safety event and the impact of health IT induced errors on medication safety. The sociotechnical model helps identify the aspects causing medication safety issues. The information value chain helps uncover the effect of the health IT induced medication errors on health care process and patient outcomes.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events and Modes of Failure Related to Impella RP: Insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Right ventricular (RV) mechanical circulatory support remains an important adjunctive therapy for RV failure refractory to medical therapy. Impella RP (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) is approved for providing temporary RV support for patients with acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery. Robust data on the most commonly reported complications and failure modes for the Impella RP are lacking. We analyzed the post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to assess these endpoints. MATERIALS/METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for the time period January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2018, for Impella devices by Searching for the following event types: \"injury\", \"malfunction\", \"death\", and \"other\". The search yielded 436 device reports. Impella RP medical device reports were screened, and 35 reports were included for the final analysis. RESULTS: In cases of reported complications, Impella RP was placed most commonly for right ventricular failure (RVF) developing in postcardiotomy patients (20%). The most commonly reported complications included bleeding (42.9%) and vascular complications (22.8%). The modes of failure included damage or fracture of the device elements (34.2%); thrombus, or clot in the system (17.1%); and device detachment (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight the failure modes of the Impella RP device that should be addressed in order to improve the device performance and obtain improved clinical outcomes when utilized for RVF.",

    "Title": "Lasers and energy-based devices marketed for vaginal rejuvenation: A cross-sectional analysis of the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The FDA issued a statement on July 30, 2018, expressing concern over the marketing of lasers and energy-based devices to promote \"vaginal rejuvenation.\" The FDA stated that there is insufficient data to recommend this modality for optimization of sexual function and alleviation of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)-related symptoms in postmenopausal or postpartum women. This analysis aims to characterize the mandatory and voluntary reports concerning laser and energy-based procedures marketed for vaginal rejuvenation. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of the FDA database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), for events related to laser and energy-based devices for vaginal rejuvenation. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and January 2019, 45 distinct events describing 46 patients were recorded and reviewed. The most commonly reported adverse event related to the procedure was pain (vulvar, bladder, urethral, or unspecified) (n = 19). The majority of patients sought medical care for their injuries, which included evaluation by urgent care, urology, gynecology, neurology, gastroenterology, pelvic floor therapy, primary care providers, and the device operator. Thirty-three patients indicated chronicity of their injury, which included long-term pain, numbness, burning, bladder disturbances, infections, scarring, dyspareunia, worsening symptoms, aggravation of lichen sclerosis, and disfigurement. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of adverse events associated with the use of laser and energy-based devices for \"vaginal rejuvenation\" was reported to the MAUDE database. Although the circumstances surrounding these events were unclear, these reports signify the importance of clinical trials that investigate the efficacy and safety profile of laser and energy-based devices for optimization of sexual function and treatment of GSM-related symptoms.

    "Title": "Techniques to Optimize the Use of Optical Coherence Tomography: Insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution intravascular imaging modality used to assess coronary arteries and as an adjunctive tool for optimization of percutaneous coronary interventions. Overall, the rate of complications and adverse events related to intravascular imaging is low. Limited data exist on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure related to the use of OCT. Therefore, we analyzed the post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to assess the reported complications and failure modes for OCT and reviewed techniques to optimize device use. METHODS/MATERIALS: The MAUDE database was queried for all event reports involving coronary OCT devices. Two independent reviewers identified 49 device reports included in the final analysis. Modes of failure and device-related patient complications were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 49 cases with reported device-related issues, 6.1% involved malfunction prior to insertion of the OCT catheter, and 30.6% of reported events did not result in an associated patient-related adverse event. The most commonly reported adverse events included coronary dissection and difficulty removing the catheter within a previously stented segment. No events of contrast-induced nephropathy were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight the modes of device-related events associated with OCT. Device issues are uncommon, and as a result, users should be aware of optimal techniques to prevent and minimize adverse events related to device use.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the commonly reported complications and failure modes for FilterWire EZ Embolic Protection Devices (EPD) by analyzing the postmarketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. BACKGROUND: EPDs prevent distal embolization of atheroembolic materials during percutaneous interventions resulting in reduced microvascular obstruction and improved microcirculation while maintaining tissue perfusion. The FilterWire EZ EPD (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) is approved for use in interventions of de novo saphenous vein grafts (SVG) and carotid artery stenosis. Robust data on the commonly reported complications and failure modes associated with the FilterWire EZ device are limited. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from September 1, 2008, through September 30, 2018, for FilterWire EZ system, yielding 474 reports. After exclusion of duplicate and incomplete reports, 464 device reports were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Device-related adverse events were most commonly reported for carotid (n = 281) and SVG (n = 101) interventions. The most commonly reported major complications were: ischemic stroke (n = 57), vessel perforation or dissection (n = 12), death (n = 8), and myocardial infarction (n = 5). Minor complications included: hypotension (n = 68), bradycardia (n = 41), and vasospasm (n = 27). The most commonly reported failure modes were: detachment and/or damage of the device components (n = 118), device entrapment (n = 90), and stent-related issues (n = 46). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the MAUDE dataset is helpful in identifying the commonly reported adverse events and failure modes of FilterWire EZ devices. This platform serves as an important tool for both physicians and manufacturers to optimize device performance and clinical outcomes.",

    "Title": "Device Malfunctions and Complications Associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Surgery: Review of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "Introduction and Objectives: Multiple surgical therapies for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) have been developed to decrease complications and increase provider efficiency. We investigated contemporary BPH treatment device-related adverse events by searching a publicly available database. Materials and Methods: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for contemporary BPH treatments. All devices were evaluated for malfunction, patient complications, and manufacturer review. The MAUDE adverse event classification system was used to standardize complications. Univariate analysis was performed to identify associations between BPH devices and adverse events. Results: A total of 2567 reports were identified: transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) 197 (7.67%), holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) 39 (1.52%), GreenLight™ 2315 (90.2%), and UroLift® 16 (0.62%). The most common deviations for each modality included cutting loop detachment during TURP 116 (58.9%), morcellator dysfunction for HoLEP 23 (58.9%), tip fracture/detachment for GreenLight (68.8%), and failure to deploy during UroLift 10 (62.5%). Only 18 (0.7%) patients required medical/surgical management (MAUDE II-IV) due to a device complication. No significant relationship was seen between each modality and complications; however, morcellator use (27.8%) was observed in higher grade complications. Manufacturer review occurred in 61.7% of cases, with 41.3% of reviewed cases finding the operator the cause of the malfunction. Conclusion: Each BPH modality investigated had minimal patient harm with over 99% of patients experiencing no complication after device malfunction. Of note, great care should be taken with morcellator use during HoLEP as it had the greatest number of MAUDE II to IV complications among all devices. Manufacturer review revealed that over 40% of cases were due to misuse by the user. Therefore, urologists should select the modalities they are most familiar with to decrease patient harm and prevent device malfunctions.",

    "Title": "Safety of EndoAnchors in real-world use: A report from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A hostile proximal neck anatomy is the most common cause of abdominal aorta endovascular aneurysm repair failure leading to a higher risk of device migration, proximal type I endoleak, and subsequent open surgical repair. Endostapling is a technique to attain better fixation of the endograft to the aortic wall, and the only available device in the USA is Aptus Heli-FX EndoAnchor system (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). Preliminary data have shown efficacy and safety of its use, and the aim of this study is to assess device-related adverse events in real-world clinical use. METHODS: We quarried data from the publicly available Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to identify Aptus Heli-FX EndoAnchor system-related adverse reports in endovascular aneurysm repair since FDA approval till August 31, 2017. An estimate of total devices implanted in the United States was quoted around 7,000 (Medtronic marketing internal data). RESULTS: Our query identified 229 separate reports, of which there were 85 adverse events (1.2% of the estimated EndoAnchor systems used). The most common adverse events were device dislodgement/fracture (65) and applicator malfunction (20). CONCLUSION: In early post-FDA approval use in a real-world setting, the EndoAnchor system is associated with a low rate of adverse events. Device dislodgement and embolization remain the most common adverse events. With increasing use of these devices in more difficult anatomy, careful patient selection and careful attention to technique may help to reduce these events even further.",

    "Title": "Robotic Urologic Surgery: Trends in Food and Drug Administration-Reported Adverse Events Over the Last Decade.",
    "Abstract": "Background: The da Vinci Surgical System has led to a rapid growth in the volume of robot-assisted surgeries, with 877,000 surgeries performed in 2017. Despite the increasing prevalence of robotic urologic surgeries, few long-term studies exist that examine trends in reported adverse events (RAEs). We analyzed RAEs over the past decade. Materials and Methods: We extrapolated all entries from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database with the manufacturer \"Intuitive Surgical\" from 2007 to 2017. Reports were analyzed for date and type of RAE (death, bodily injury, malfunction, and other). RAEs from urologic surgeries were analyzed further for specific information pertaining to death, bodily injury, and malfunction. Results: A total of 19,783 RAEs were analyzed. Instrument or robot malfunctions comprised the majority of RAEs (84.9%); bodily injuries comprised 8.2%. Death was the least common RAE (1.3%). RAEs for urologic robotic surgeries peaked in 2013 and 2014 and decreased since. A total of 69 (2.3%) deaths, 364 (12.2%) injuries, and 2544 (85.5%) instrument or robot malfunctions occurred. No reported deaths were attributed to system or mechanical malfunction, but rather to medical complications reported to be unrelated to surgery. The most common injuries were bowel (22.3%) and genitourinary (GU) (19.5%). Instrument malfunctions caused 16.8% of bodily injuries. Conclusions: RAEs for robotic urologic surgeries peaked in 2013 to 2014, and have decreased annually since. When malfunctions occurred, they did not result in death and infrequently resulted in bodily injury. Potential quality improvement targets include prevention of bowel and GU injuries through surgical coaching, and improved technology to prevent malfunction of the surgical system and instruments.",

    "Title": "Getting More Information From Glucose Meter Evaluations.",
    "Abstract": "Glucose meter evaluations are common in publications and inform whether the meter meets the ISO 15197 specification. The ISO 15197 specifications, which are universally cited, leave 1% of results unspecified, which can be thought of as typical performance of results (99%) versus rare performance (1%). Suggestions are provided to extract more information from these evaluations, including rare performance, since highly discrepant results or failure to obtain a result can be observed in a glucose meter that has met the ISO 15197 specification. It is also recommended that when manufacturers perform evaluations, they analyze adverse events contained in the FDA MAUDE database. Finally, we point out an important problem with the ISO 15197 specifications.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the reported complications and event modes for the GuideLiner and Guidezilla extension catheters. METHODS/MATERIALS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reported events. RESULTS: Of the 65 cases with reported GuideLiner-related issues, 15 (23%) involved the inability to pass equipment through or damage to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) devices in the GuideLiner catheter, 38 (58%) involved GuideLiner catheter fracture, 9 (14%) involved coronary artery dissection, 2 (3%) involved coronary artery perforation, and 1 (1.5%) involved thrombus formation in the catheter. Of the 408 cases with reported Guidezilla-related issues, 53 (13%) involved inability to pass or damaged PCI devices into the Guidezilla catheter, 117 (29%) involved inability to advance the Guidezilla catheter to the target lesion, 59 (14%) involved kinked Guidezilla catheter, mostly because of partial or complete catheter fracture upon further investigation, 164 (40%) involved a broken Guidezilla catheter, 10 (2.5%) involved coronary artery dissection, 2 (0.5%) involved coronary artery perforation, 1 (0.2%)involved aortic dissection, 1 (0.2%) involved thrombosis formation, and 1 (0.2%) involved no-reflow phenomenon. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight the complications and modes of events associated with the use of GuideLiner and Guidezilla extension catheters. SUMMARY: To assess the reported complications and event modes for the GuideLiner and Guidezilla extension catheters, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried. There were more reports on Guidezilla-related events during the search period. The events for both extension catheters mainly involved the inability to pass equipment through or damage to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) devices in the extension catheter, extension catheter fracture, coronary artery dissection and perforation and, occasionally, the death of the patients.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Innovations in cancer treatment coupled with an increasing number of cancer patients have led to the growth of brachytherapy devices. The objective of this study is to characterize the development and safety of brachytherapy devices marketed in the United States (US) over the last 15 years. Methods We reviewed records from a public US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database detailing premarket approval of brachytherapy devices. All 510(k) submissions approved between January 1, 2000 and October 31, 2018 were examined. To assess the safety of these devices, we searched the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database for related adverse events. Results Twenty-two brachytherapy devices received 510(k) premarket approval, with the first device approved in 2005. Of the 22 devices, 20 (91%) were marketed with specific indications. The most common indications include treatment of skin cancers and keloids (n=7), breast cancer (n=4), and gynecologic/rectal cancers (n=2). A review of the MAUDE database revealed 64 reports of adverse events associated with brachytherapy devices. Common adverse effects include poor device design, use error, and device malfunction that led to the delivery of an inaccurate dose of radiation. Discussion Although there are some single-center, short-term studies demonstrating adequate local control and satisfactory cosmesis with brachytherapy, data on long-term outcomes are lacking. Further research is warranted to define appropriate practice guidelines for brachytherapy devices in the treatment of various malignancies.",

    "Title": "Small bowel obstructions following the use of barbed suture: a review of the literature and analysis of the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Barbed suture has been adopted across all surgical specialties. One of the infrequent complications seen with the use of barbed suture is small bowel obstructions (SBOs). In this study, we perform a review of the literature and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) to characterize SBOs after the use of barbed sutures in a variety of operative procedures. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed by searching PubMed and Ovid. We used the search terms: \"barbed,\" \"suture,\" \"bowel,\" and \"obstructions.\" For each case report, we examined the initial surgical procedure, type of barbed suture used, the type of complication, the time to complication, the presentation, and the type of operative interventions required. We did the same with the MAUDE database. RESULTS: Our review of the literature revealed 18 different cases of SBO secondary to the use of barbed suture. The four most common procedures, with a total of four cases each, were inguinal hernia procedures, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and pelvic floor reconstructive procedures. The average time of presentation to SBO was found to be 26.3 days post-op (1-196 days). A total of 16 patients (88.9%) presented with abdominal pain. Other common complaints included vomiting (33.3%), abdominal distension (27.8%), oral intolerance (22.2%), and constipation (16.7%). A total of 5 cases were also found to have a possible volvulus on computed tomography (CT), and 2 cases were reported to have strangulation. The MAUDE database had 14 cases reporting on obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons should have a high index of suspicion for SBO if a patient presents with obstructive symptoms after a surgery that used barbed suture. This will often present as a mesenteric volvulus on CT. These particular SBOs require operative exploration, with laparoscopy being successful in the majority of cases.",

    "Abstract": "The most common complications of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy are generally related to surgical site infection and hardware malfunction. Less well understood are the adverse neurological effects of this therapy. We present the case of a patient who underwent placement of a Senza HF10 high-frequency spinal cord stimulator with subsequent development of tinnitus, vertigo, intermittent involuntary left facial twitches, and perioral numbness. These symptoms resolved following deactivation of her device. To further explore these less common neurologic complications of SCS therapy, a review of literature and a review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database are included. Further research and investigation in this area are needed so that clinicians and patients may have more complete knowledge and understanding of the potential treatment-limiting complications of spinal cord stimulation.",

    "Title": "Building Usability Knowledge for Health Information Technology: A Usability-Oriented Analysis of Incident Reports.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The contribution of usability flaws to patient safety issues is acknowledged but not well-investigated. Free-text descriptions of incident reports may provide useful data to identify the connection between health information technology (HIT) usability flaws and patient safety. OBJECTIVES: This article examines the feasibility of using incident reports about HIT to learn about the usability flaws that affect patient safety. We posed three questions: (1) To what extent can we gain knowledge about usability issues from incident reports? (2) What types of usability flaws, related usage problems, and negative outcomes are reported in incidents reports? (3) What are the reported usability issues that give rise to patient safety issues? METHODS: A sample of 359 reports from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was examined. Descriptions of usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were extracted and categorized. A supplementary analysis was performed on the incidents which contained the full chain going from a usability flaw up to a patient safety issue to identify the usability issues that gave rise to patient safety incidents. RESULTS: A total of 249 reports were included. We found that incident reports can provide knowledge about usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes. Thirty-six incidents report how usability flaws affected patient safety (ranging from incidents without consequence, to death) involving electronic patient scales, imaging systems, and HIT for medication management. The most significant class of involved usability flaws is related to the reliability, the understandability, and the availability of the clinical information. CONCLUSION: Incidents reports involving HIT are an exploitable source of information to learn about usability flaws and their effects on patient safety. Results can be used to convince all stakeholders involved in the HIT system lifecycle that usability should be considered seriously to prevent patient safety incidents.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A review of the medical device adverse events submitted to the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was undertaken to determine the major sources of the information. METHODS: The reporter's occupation and source of the medical device report were determined for acquisition dates Jan 1, 1997 to Dec 31, 2018. A total of 7,766,737 adverse event records were analyzed. RESULTS: 96.6% of reports originated with the manufacturer. Patients (patients/family/friend) were the most frequent submitter of reports directly to the FDA, almost five times as often as physicians. Nurses submitted reports directly to the FDA 2.77 times as often as physicians. Only 0.49% of physician reports were submitted directly to the FDA, representing 0.09% of total MAUDE reports. CONCLUSION: Increasing physician reporting directly to the FDA and MAUDE through the MedWatch reporting system is an imperative. Incorporating information from the perspective of the physician has the potential of increasing the quality of the data and improving the reliability of post-market surveillance.",

    "Title": "Menstrual cup use, leakage, acceptability, safety, and availability: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Girls and women need effective, safe, and affordable menstrual products. Single-use products are regularly selected by agencies for resource-poor settings; the menstrual cup is a less known alternative. We reviewed international studies on menstrual cup leakage, acceptability, and safety and explored menstrual cup availability to inform programmes. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Popline, Cinahl, Global Health database, Emerald, Google Scholar, Science.gov, and WorldWideScience from database inception to May 14, 2019, for quantitative or qualitative studies published in English on experiences and leakage associated with menstrual cups, and adverse event reports. We also screened the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from the US Food and Drug Administration for events related to menstrual cups. To be eligible for inclusion, the material needed to have information on leakage, acceptability, or safety of menstrual cups. The main outcome of interest was menstrual blood leakage when using a menstrual cup. Safety outcomes of interest included serious adverse events; vaginal abrasions and effects on vaginal microflora; effects on the reproductive, digestive, or urinary tract; and safety in poor sanitary conditions. Findings were tabulated or combined by use of forest plots (random-effects meta-analysis). We also did preliminary estimates on costs and environmental savings potentially associated with cups. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42016047845. FINDINGS: Of 436 records identified, 43 studies were eligible for analysis (3319 participants). Most studies reported on vaginal cups (27 [63%] vaginal cups, five [12%] cervical cups, and 11 [25%] mixed types of cups or unknown) and 15 were from low-income and middle-income countries. 22 studies were included in qualitative or quantitative syntheses, of which only three were of moderate-to-high quality. Four studies made a direct comparison between menstrual cups and usual products for the main outcome of leakage and reported leakage was similar or lower for menstrual cups than for disposable pads or tampons (n=293). In all qualitative studies, the adoption of the menstrual cup required a familiarisation phase over several menstrual cycles and peer support improved uptake (two studies in developing countries). In 13 studies, 73% (pooled estimate: n=1144; 95% CI 59-84, I2=96%) of participants wished to continue use of the menstrual cup at study completion. Use of the menstrual cup showed no adverse effects on the vaginal flora (four studies, 507 women). We identified five women who reported severe pain or vaginal wounds, six reports of allergies or rashes, nine of urinary tract complaints (three with hydronephrosis), and five of toxic shock syndrome after use of the menstrual cup. Dislodgement of an intrauterine device was reported in 13 women who used the menstrual cup (eight in case reports, and five in one study) between 1 week and 13 months of insertion of the intrauterine device. Professional assistance to aid removal of menstrual cup was reported among 47 cervical cup users and two vaginal cup users. We identified 199 brands of menstrual cup, and availability in 99 countries with prices ranging US$0·72-46·72 (median $23·3, 145 brands). INTERPRETATION: Our review indicates that menstrual cups are a safe option for menstruation management and are being used internationally. Good quality studies in this field are needed. Further studies are needed on cost-effectiveness and environmental effect comparing different menstrual products.

    "Abstract": "In an article in Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Arnold et al have presented a thorough study of imprecision components for a point-of-care hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) assay. An interesting and innovative approach is the combination of data from different studies to arrive at a total error estimate. But total error has the oxymoron feature of estimating performance for most (95%) but not all of the results. An HbA1c error grid would provide the severity for results that exceed the 6% requirement. Since this device is intended for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments waived labs and allows for finger-stick samples, monitoring the Food and Drug Administration adverse event database (MAUDE, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide an overview of the types of adverse events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for magnetic resonance (MR) systems over a 10-yr period. METHODS: Two reviewers independently reviewed adverse events reported to FDA for MR systems from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017 and manually categorized events into eight event types. Thermal events were further subcategorized by probable cause. Objects that became projectiles were also categorized. RESULTS: FDA received 1568 adverse event reports for MR systems between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2017. This analysis included 1548 reports. Thermal events were the most commonly reported serious injury (59% of analyzed reports). Mechanical events - defined as slips, falls, crush injuries, broken bones, and cuts; musculoskeletal injuries from lifting or movement of the device - (11%), projectile events (9%), and acoustic events (6%) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events related to MR systems consistent with the known hazards of the MR environment continue to be reported to FDA. Increased awareness of the types of adverse events occurring for MR imaging systems is important for prevention.",

    "Abstract": "Patient safety events (PSEs), or medical errors, are major impediments to healthcare system safety. Health information technology (HIT) is expected to promote quality of care. Nonetheless, HIT also creates unintended consequences that concern patient safety consolidating a high-quality database of HIT events is essential to understanding their nature. Previous studies demonstrated the potential to use FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to extract HIT events. In this study, we utilized classic and CNN models to extract HIT events from MAUDE. Both individual and combined models were evaluated on the test set, where the best model identified HIT events with ~90% accuracy and achieved a ~.87 f1 score. This model was capable of identifying HIT events in an HIT-exclusive database and serving as a quality and error check tool during event reporting. Moreover, the strategy of HIT event identification may scale in developing other PSE subtype-specific databases.",

    "Title": "Valuing innovative endoscopic techniques: endoscopic suturing to prevent stent migration for benign esophageal disease.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Reimbursement often presents a significant barrier to widespread adoption of innovative endoscopic devices. We aimed to determine the value (defined as cost savings to a payer) of endoscopic suturing devices in preventing the migration of esophageal stents placed for benign esophageal diseases. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed from a payer perspective evaluating fully covered metal stent placement for benign esophageal diseases (fistula, leak, perforation, or stricture) in a hospital outpatient setting. The model compared 2 strategies: endoscopic suturing to anchor the stent or no suture. Health care outcomes and costs were derived from published systematic reviews and national databases (U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience [MAUDE] for safety data; 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and Provider Utilization and Payment Data databases for reimbursement data). RESULTS: From a payer perspective, reimbursement for care increased by US$1487.98 without endoscopic suturing per patient, compared with US$621.06 with endoscopic suturing, to cover the risk of stent migration in addition to usual professional and facility reimbursement for stent placement. Thus, an average cost saving of US$866.92 per patient was achieved with endoscopic suturing to reduce stent migration risks. Cost savings associated with suturing ranged from US$147.48 to US$1586.36 per patient, based on the indication for the procedure in sensitivity analysis. Cost savings increased with higher rates of technical success in suture placement. CONCLUSIONS: Creating a defined reimbursement pathway for endoscopic suture fixation of a stent for the treatment of benign esophageal diseases appears to be justified from a payer perspective.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: SpaceOAR® is a Food and Drug Administration-approved hydrogel injection used to create space between the prostate and rectum during prostate radiotherapy. It has shown to significantly reduce the rectal radiation dose with lower rates of rectal toxicity. Despite a high safety performance in initial trials, SpaceOAR remains in early clinical use. Thus, we examined emerging safety reports as the system becomes more widely utilized. Methods: We reviewed the SpaceOAR manufacturer website for the safety profile and complications associated with the SpaceOAR hydrogel. We then compared this with reports submitted to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Results: The manufacturer website reported risks including pain, needle penetration, and/or gel injection into a nearby organ or blood vessel, local inflammation, infection, urinary retention, and local rectal injury or symptoms. There were 22 unique reports discussing 25 patient cases in the MAUDE database from January 2015 to March 2019, with an increasing number of reports each year up through 2018. Unique major complications including acute pulmonary embolism, severe anaphylaxis, prostatic abscess and sepsis, purulent perineal drainage, rectal wall erosion, and rectourethral fistula were reported. Conclusion: Despite well-documented clinical benefits of the SpaceOAR System, there are a number of severe and debilitating complications recently reported in proximity to gel injection. This highlights the need for further study of device complications in light of its increasing clinical use.",

    "Title": "Complications and Litigation Associated With Injectable Facial Fillers: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Soft-tissue injectable fillers are a popular treatment option for patients seeking minimally invasive facial rejuvenation. The use of soft-tissue fillers has increased significantly in the past 10 years. In 2017 alone, clinicians administered nearly 2.7 million soft-tissue fillers, up from 1.3 million in 2007. Although injectable fillers have a relatively high safety profile compared with more invasive rejuvenation procedures, serious adverse events, including intra-arterial injections, necrosis, and visual symptoms such as blindness, have been documented. Complications from injectable fillers have also been a source of litigation, which has been shown to be associated with a perceived lack of informed consent. We sought to document the reported complication rates associated with injectable facial fillers from a national database and to report on the available cases of malpractice litigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was used to collect the reported complications from 2013 to 2017 for the following injectable fillers: Artefill, Bellafill, Belotero, Juvederm, Radiesse, Restylane, Sculptra, and Kybella. Complications were organized by filler type, injection location, and complication type. The Thomson Reuters Westlaw Edge database was used to collect the reported jury verdicts and settlements from 2008 to 2017 for injectable facial fillers. RESULTS: A total of 2813 adverse events were analyzed. The most common locations for complications were the cheek (915 [32.5%]), lips (503 [17.9%]), and nasolabial fold (412 [14.6%]). The commonly reported adverse events were swelling (1,691 [60.1%]), nodule (948 [33.7%]), and pain (636 [22.6%]). Severe complications included intra-arterial injections resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (eg, blurred vision and blindness). Forehead and dorsal nasal injections were significantly associated with intra-arterial complications resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (P < .01). Injections with Radiesse were significantly associated with intra-arterial injections resulting in necrosis and visual symptoms (P < .01). A total of 11 malpractice cases were analyzed. The median award in the cases resolved by a verdict in favor of the plaintiff or settlement was $600,000. In 10 of the 11 cases, a lack of informed consent had been alleged. CONCLUSIONS: The complications associated with injectable facial fillers varied greatly, depending on factors involved with their application. The most common adverse effects were swelling, nodule formation, and pain. Serious complications stemming from intra-arterial injections included necrosis and visual disturbances, including blindness. These complications have been raised in legal cases, in which the lack of informed consent was frequently alleged. The present analysis has documented some of the potential risks involved with injectable facial fillers and demonstrated the need for a thorough informed consent process before their administration.",

    "Abstract": "AIMS: Rotating sheaths and laser sheaths are commonly used for transvenous lead extraction. This study aims to compare observed mortality between both approaches. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched from 2011 to 2016 to determine number of deaths associated with each sheath. An independent analytics firm provided estimates for number of cases done, allowing calculation of market share. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine relative risk (RR) of mortality at the calculated market share (36% rotating/64% laser) and two others. Additional sensitivity analyses assumed underreporting of deaths associated with rotating sheaths. An estimated 50 545 extractions were performed. Thirteen deaths were associated with rotating sheaths compared to 167 with laser sheaths. Of these, 92% (rotating) and 95% (laser) were due to cardiovascular injury. At the calculated market share, the RR of death was 7.2 times greater with laser sheaths [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1-12.7, P < 0.0001]. At market share estimates of 25% rotating/75% laser and 45% rotating/55% laser, the RR of death with laser sheaths was 4.3 (95% CI 2.4-7.5, P < 0.0001) and 10.5 times greater (95% CI 6.0-18.5, P < 0.0001), respectively. The RR of death remained significant when assuming deaths with rotating sheaths were underreported and when deaths using both sheaths were attributed to the rotating sheath. CONCLUSIONS: Lead extraction with laser sheaths appears to be associated with a higher risk of mortality compared to rotating sheaths. Further studies are warranted to confirm this finding.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reports on the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) cumulatively demonstrate a low rate of complications, but clinical experience with this technology is limited compared with transvenous devices. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze S-ICD complications reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. METHODS: We reviewed all S-ICD events reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience submitted over 24 months (from February 2016 through February 2018) through a prospective and standardized approach at a time when an estimated 15,000 S-ICDs were in service. RESULTS: After removing duplicate entries and nonclinical events (n = 493), 1604 events remained. A total of 542 instances of infection were reported with system removal in 414/542 (77.5%). Inappropriate shocks occurred in 550 patients, and 382 (69%) were attributed to oversensing; in response, 254 (56%), 147 (33%), and 80 (18%) patients underwent system reprogramming, removal, or revision, respectively. There were 15 deaths, and causes included defibrillation failure during follow-up (n = 2), ventricular fibrillation induced by the device (n = 4), device-device interaction resulting in undersensing (n = 1), procedure-related complications (n = 4), and uncertain etiology (n = 4). There were 137 reports of system migration, and in 57 (42%) of these, there were associated inappropriate shocks. System migration events were managed with a combination of system revision (69 [51%]), reprogramming (25 [18%]), and system removal (44 [32%]). CONCLUSION: Several S-ICD complications have been reported that appear to be related to the ICD's design and function over time. A better understanding of these complications may help inform patient selection, implant technique, and postimplantation management.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the rising popularity of dermal fillers, the number of complications associated with fillers has increased. OBJECTIVE: To identify and review reports of adverse events involving cosmetic injectable soft-tissue fillers from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from June 1993 to August 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors conducted a search of adverse events within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration database that involved injectable dermal fillers for soft-tissue augmentation from June 1993 to August 2014. Search terms included generic and trade names of commercially available soft-tissue fillers. RESULTS: Three thousand seven hundred eighty-two complications involving dermal fillers were identified in the MAUDE database. Forty-four percent of complications implicated hyaluronic acid fillers, 40% involved poly-L-lactic acid fillers, 15% complications included calcium hydroxylapatite fillers, and <1% complications arose from polymethylmethacrylate fillers. Common adverse events included lumps, infection, allergic reaction, ischemia, and swelling. Rare events included trigger of autoimmune reactions, visual disturbances, and stroke. CONCLUSION: Although complications with dermal fillers are infrequent in comparison with the growing number of filler procedures being performed in the United States every year, this study underscores the importance of appropriate skill and training when administering dermal fillers. Physicians using injectable dermal fillers should be trained to recognize potential complications and know how to appropriately manage them.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Balloon sinuplasty utilization has increased significantly since its introduction over a decade ago. However, the most common associated complications are still unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze adverse events related to balloon sinuplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience; 2008-2018). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for all reports on adverse events involving balloon sinuplasty devices from the 3 leading manufacturers: Acclarent, Entellus, and Medtronic. Reported events were reviewed and categorized. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 211 adverse events from 208 reports divided into the following categories: patient related (n = 102, 48.3%), device related (n = 101, 47.9%), and packaging related (n = 8, 3.8%). Four periprocedural deaths were reported but were not clearly associated with technical complications. The most common device-related complications were guide catheter malfunction (39.6%), balloon malfunction (38.6%), and imprecise navigation (17.8%). The most common patient-related complications were cerebrospinal fluid leak (36.3%), eye swelling (29.4%), and epistaxis (11.8%). A lateral canthotomy was performed in 30.0% of eye-swelling complications. Sixty percent of eye complications occurred during balloon dilation of the maxillary sinus. The years 2014 (n = 48) and 2012 (n = 32) had the highest number of adverse events reported as compared with all other years. CONCLUSION: The most common adverse events associated with balloon sinuplasty include balloon malfunction, guide catheter malfunction, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and significant eye swelling. Health care providers should discuss these possible complications when consenting patients for balloon sinuplasty.",

    "Title": "Complications of Palatal Pillar Implants: An analysis of the MAUDE database and literature review.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The Pillar Palatal Implant System is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. Prior studies have examined the effectiveness of this procedure, however no prior study has thoroughly evaluated its complications. We anticipate that this analysis will provide valuable insight into these procedures which can be used in patient education and post-operative follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for cases reporting injury related to the pillar procedure. The case narratives were individually analyzed and categorized by type of complication. A comparison of extruding parts and select complications was also performed using chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Of the 261 cases reported, 73.6% reporting extruding parts, 47.5% described patient pain, and 38.7% included patients describing a foreign body sensation. Infection was reported in 7.7% of the cases with cellulitis and abscess formation specifically mentioned in one case. Cases describing pain and difficulty swallowing were significantly more likely to have reported extruding parts (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes various complications associated with this procedure. The description of these complications and accompanying literature review may provide healthcare professionals and patients with an understanding of the scope of adverse events related to this procedure.",

    "Title": "Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for Patient- and Circuit-Related Adverse Events Involving Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: We assessed commonly reported patient- and circuit-related adverse events involving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices by analyzing post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. ECMO is a rescue therapy for critically ill patients requiring oxygenation and cardiopulmonary support. Key configurations include veno-venous (VV) ECMO for respiratory support and veno-arterial (VA) ECMO for cardio-respiratory support. Robust data on the most commonly reported complications associated with ECMO therapy are limited. METHODS/MATERIALS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 1, 2009, through March 31, 2019, yielding 93 reports. After excluding duplicate reports, 82 reports were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Percentages represent the proportion of total submitted MAUDE reports on ECMO. Of the reported cases, 24 were VV-ECMO, 8 were VA-ECMO, and the remainder were unspecified. The most commonly reported patient-related adverse events included hemodynamic decompensation of patients (12.2%), death (12.2%), atrial perforation (7.3%), and bleeding (7.3%). The most commonly reported failure modes were in the following circuit components: mechanical pump (19.5%, mostly due to technical failure or clots), membrane oxygenator (19.5%, mostly due to tear in the membrane or temperature probe), and access cannulae (18.3%, mostly due to structural damage). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, ECMO devices are associated with important complications. With broadened global utilization of ECMO devices, standard complication and failure reporting policies may improve patient selection, operator proficiency, and existing device technology. SUMMARY: An analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database demonstrates that in real-world practice, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices are associated with serious complications. The most commonly reported patient-related adverse events were hemodynamic decompensation of patients and death, and the most commonly reported failure modes were in the device's mechanical pump and membrane oxygenator.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) is indicated for use as a cerebral protection device to capture and remove embolic material during transcatheter aortic valve procedures and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017. Robust data on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with the Sentinel device are limited. METHODS/MATERIALS: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2017 through 2019, yielding 43 reports. RESULTS: Of the 43 reports of major complications involving Sentinel devices, 23 involved either death (3) or injury (20) related to the device. The 3 deaths were due to stroke, while 18 of the 20 injuries were reported as stroke. The other 20 reports were related to device modes of failure. Modes of failure were due to damaged device (5), difficulty retrieving/resheathing the device (5); package contamination (4), difficulty deploying the device (3), and, finally, complications with preparation (3). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System may be associated with complications, including death, stroke, vascular injury, and difficulties with the device itself. The MAUDE database serves as an important tool for both physicians and manufacturers to optimize performance and clinical outcomes.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (FDA-MAUDE) voluntary database was searched for Thoracic Aortic Endovascular Repair (TEVAR) devices reported over the course of 1 year (January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014). The data abstracted included the indication for treatment, device used, and adverse events. RESULTS: During 2014, there were 334 original submissions to the FDA-MAUDE database describing 371 adverse events regarding TEVAR devices that met inclusion criteria for this study. All submissions were from manufacturers, and none were from physicians. The most common pathologies treated were thoracic aortic aneurysm (67.6%) and type B aortic dissection (25.1%). The most frequently reported intraoperative, early postoperative (<30 days), and late postoperative (>30 days) events overall were technical device failure, neurologic complications (stroke, paraplegia), and endoleak, respectively. Of note, there were descriptions of retained deployment materials, late graft infections, and aorto-visceral fistula formation up to 3 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database is a valuable repository for complications and device failures that are not otherwise in the published literature and submitted by manufacturers relating to this relatively new technology.",

    "Title": "Unrecognized maternal heart rate artefact in cases of perinatal mortality reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration from 2009 to 2019: a critical patient safety issue.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal heart rate artefact is a signal processing error whereby the fetal heart rate is masked by the maternal pulse, potentially leading to danger by failure to recognize an abnormal fetal heart rate or a pre-existing fetal death. Maternal heart rate artefact may be exacerbated by autocorrelation algorithms in modern fetal monitors due to smooth transitions between maternal and fetal heart rates rather than breaks in the tracing. In response, manufacturers of cardiotocography monitors recommend verifying fetal life prior to monitoring and have developed safeguards including signal ambiguity detection technologies to simultaneously and continuously monitor the maternal and fetal heart rates. However, these safeguards are not emphasized in current cardiotocography clinical practice guidelines, potentially leading to a patient safety gap. METHODS: The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was reviewed for records with event type \"Death\" for the time period March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2019, in combination with search terms selected to capture all cases reported involving cardiotocography devices. Records were reviewed to determine whether maternal heart rate artefact was probable and/or whether the report contained a recommendation from the device manufacturer regarding maternal heart rate artefact. RESULTS: Forty-seven cases of perinatal mortality were identified with probable maternal heart rate artefact including 14 with antepartum fetal death prior to initiation of cardiotocography, 14 with intrapartum fetal death or neonatal death after initiation of cardiotocography, and 19 where the temporal relationship between initiation of cardiotocography and death cannot be definitively established from the report. In 29 cases, there was a recommendation from the manufacturer regarding diagnosis and/or management of maternal heart rate artefact. CONCLUSIONS: This case series indicates a recurring problem with undetected maternal heart rate artefact leading to perinatal mortality and, in cases of pre-existing fetal death, healthcare provider confusion. In response, manufacturers frequently recommend safeguards which are found in their device's instructions for use but not in major intrapartum cardiotocography guidelines. Cardiotocography guidelines should be updated to include the latest safeguards against the risks of maternal heart rate artefact. An additional file summarizing key points for clinicians is included.",

    "Title": "High shocking and pacing impedances due to defibrillation lead calcification.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We have reported the calcification of Endotak defibrillation leads that required replacement. The aim of this study was to assess calcified Endotak Reliance leads in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and compare them to calcified Sprint Fidelis, Sprint Quattro Secure, Riata, and Durata leads in MAUDE. METHODS: We searched the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2019 for defibrillation lead calcification using the terms \"calcium,\" \"calcification,\" and \"calcified\". Included were explanted leads whose manufacturers found calcium on the shocking and/or pacing electrode. RESULTS: The MAUDE search identified 113 calcified defibrillation leads that qualified for the study, including 109 Endotak Reliance leads, 1 Sprint Quattro Secure lead, 2 Durata leads, 1 Riata ST lead, and no Sprint Fidelis lead. The sign of calcification was a gradual increase in shocking or pacing impedance. Average implant time was 7.4 ± 3.1 (range: 1.3-16.5) years. Only Endotak Reliance leads had shocking coil calcification (n = 72; 66.0%) and five (6.9%) of these failed defibrillation threshold (DFT) testing. Distal pacing electrode calcification affected 55 (50.4%) Endotak Reliance leads. The four other leads had pacing ring electrode calcification only. CONCLUSION: Endotak Reliance defibrillation leads appear prone to shocking coil and/or distal pacing electrode calcification. High impedances may compromise defibrillation and pacing therapy. Patients who have these leads should be monitored; those exhibiting high shocking impedances should be considered for DFT testing. Lead replacement should be considered for pacemaker-dependent patients whose leads exhibit progressively high impedances.",

    "Title": "Outcomes Before and After the Recall of a Heart Failure Pacemaker.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Timely and complete disclosure of medical device defects is necessary to manage patient care safely and effectively. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the manufacturer's recommendations following the recall of a medical device were timely and complete, the follow-up information and data provided to patients and physicians were adequate for managing patient care, and the actions taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the recall were appropriate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-center retrospective case series included 90 of 448 patients who were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker at the Minneapolis Heart Institute from May 2003 through January 2011; this pacemaker was recalled in November 2015. In addition, returned product reports submitted by the manufacturer to the FDA via the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2008 through December 2018 were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were serious adverse clinical events that occurred before and after the November 2015 recall notifying physicians and patients that the device's battery could fail unexpectedly because of high internal impedance. Technical outcomes were signs and causes of failure. RESULTS: Five of 90 patients observed during 2015 experienced syncope when their pacemakers stopped pacing owing to battery or wire connection defects prior to the recall. Of the 90 patients, 37 (41%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age at implantation was 71.3 (66.1-78.2) years. Analysis of the MAUDE data revealed that battery failures prior to the recall were associated with serious adverse events that included 1 death, 1 cardiac arrest, 5 syncopal attacks, and 6 heart failure exacerbations; 3 additional prerecall syncopal events were caused by wire connection defects. The manufacturer and the FDA were aware of the battery and wire connection defects for 19 months before issuing the recall, yet the wire connection problem was not included in the advisory and physicians were not informed that interrogating the pacemaker could result in loss of pacing. The FDA classified the recall as class II rather than the more critical class I. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This case series study of patients implanted with a defective pacemaker found that the pacemaker recall was delayed and that subsequent communications did not include all critical information needed for safe and effective patient care. These findings should prompt reforms in how the medical device industry and the FDA manage future medical device recalls.",

    "Title": "Early Polyethylene Failure in a Modern Total Hip Prosthesis: A Note of Caution.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Historically, there has been excellent survivorship of total hip arthroplasty with newer implants expected to outperform prior generations. Review of our institutional database identified problems with one particular cross-linked polyethylene liner in mid-term follow-up, which has not been reported in the literature. We report on the technical aspects of this liner, as well as the clinical and radiographic factors associated with early failure of this bearing in our practice. METHODS: A retrospective review of our institutional database was performed from January 2009 to June 2019 of patients who presented with significant osteolysis in the setting of prior total hip arthroplasty with a contemporary polyethylene liner. Demographic and radiographic measures were collected for all patients. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified, with nine undergoing revision surgery. All patients demonstrated radiographic osteolysis at the time of revision surgery. The average time to diagnosis of failure was 55.9 months (range: 12-120 months). Average cup position preoperatively was 44 degrees inclination (range: 36-53 degrees) and 21 degrees anteversion (range: 10-34 degrees). Nine patients underwent revision of the acetabular component, with two also undergoing femoral component revision. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database revealed 22 reported cases of wear-related failure from 2009 to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that no identifiable risk factors related to patient demographics or implant position were identified, the Exactech Connexion GXL liner may be prone to a high rate of early failure from wear and severe secondary osteolysis. We recommend close surveillance of patients with this bearing surface.",

    "Title": "Toward safer health care: a review strategy of FDA medical device adverse event database to identify and categorize health information technology related events.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health information technology (HIT) is intended to provide safer and better care to patients. However, poorly designed or implemented HIT poses a key risk to patient safety. It is essential for healthcare providers and researchers to investigate the HIT-related events. Unfortunately, the lack of HIT-related event databases in the community hinders the analysis and management of HIT-related events. OBJECTIVES: Develop a standardized process for identifying HIT-related events from a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) database in order to create an HIT exclusive database for analysis and learning. METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, containing over 7-million reports about medical device malfunctions and problems leading to serious injury or death, was considered as a potential resource to identify HIT-related events. We developed a strategy of identifying and categorizing HIT-related events from the FDA reports through the application of a keyword filter and standardized expert review. Ten percent identified reports were reviewed to measure the consistency among experts and to initialize a database for HIT-related events. RESULTS: With the proposed strategy, we initialized an HIT-related event database with over 3500 reports, and updated the estimation of the HIT-related event proportion in the FDA MAUDE database to 0.46∼0.69%, up to 50,000 HIT-related events. CONCLUSION: The proposed strategy for HIT-related event identification holds promise in aiding the understanding, characterization, discovery, and reporting of HIT-related events toward improved patient safety. The analysis of contributing factors under the 8-dimensional sociotechnical model shows that hardware and software, clinical content, and human-computer interface were identified more frequently than the other dimensions.",

    "Title": "A 20-Year Analysis of Adverse Events and Litigation With Light-Based Skin Resurfacing Procedures.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The popularity and availability of facial rejuvenation procedures have increased exponentially during the previous decade. The present study aimed to provide an overview of photorejuvenation and evaluate the complications and litigation related to light-based skin resurfacing procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) registry and the Thomson Reuter Westlaw Edge database from May 1, 1999 to May 1, 2019. The MAUDE registry was queried using the manufacturer brands. Adverse events were individually reviewed, and data were gathered regarding the company, complication, body location, and device type. The litigation cases were individually reviewed, and information was gathered on plaintiff gender, defendant specialty, allegation, jury verdict, the appeals verdict, and the award amount, if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 697 adverse events were included in the final sample. The most commonly reported complications were burns (61.1%), followed by scarring (16.2%), hyperpigmentation (7.8%), and hypopigmentation (7.0%). More rare, noncosmetic complications included infection (3.9%) and nerve (1.4%) and ocular (1.3%) damage. The rates of scarring with facial treatments were greater (24.3 vs 10.3%; P < .01) and the rates of burns with ablative lasers were lower (25.9 vs 66.0%; P < .01). With respect to litigation, of the 9 cases identified, all the plaintiffs were women. The most common allegation was procedural negligence (88.8%), followed by cosmetic deformity (77.7%) and the lack of informed consent (55.5%). The jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff in 4 cases (44.4%), and the mean award was $656,000. CONCLUSIONS: The most common adverse events were burns, scars, and pigmentation changes. Patient expectations could play a role in the reporting of adverse events. Negligence was the most common basis for litigation, consistent with what has been reported for other procedures. Future studies should evaluate whether increasing exposure to cosmetic phototherapies during residency and fellowship training will reduce future complication rates and alleged malpractice.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Recent safety issues involving medical devices have highlighted the need for better postmarket surveillance (PMS) evaluation. This article aims to describe and to assess the quality of the PMS data for a medical device and, finally, to provide recommendations to improve the data gathering process. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of medical device reports (MDRs) on the use of MRA, a specific type of hip implant replacement submitted to the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. The number of reports was described as the number of MDRs per unique MDR number and stratified by different variables. The quality was assessed by the level of completeness of the collected PMS data. RESULTS: The total number of reports related to MRA was 2377, and the number of MDRs per year ranged between 84 in 2009 and 452 in 2017. Most of the reports were reported by manufacturer Depuy Johnson & Johnson and were reported by a physician. In 44.9% of the reports, the device problem was reported as \"Unknown.\" When the device problem was known, in the majority of cases, it was related to an implant fracture. The quality of the collected data was assessed as low due to missing information. CONCLUSION: The underlying data should meet high quality standards to generate more evidence and to ensure a timely signal generation. This case study shows that the completeness and quality of the MDRs can be improved. The authors propose the development of tools to ensure a more dynamic complaint data collection to contribute to this enhancement.",

    "Title": "Medical device active surveillance of spontaneous reports: A literature review of signal detection methods.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The collection and analysis of real-world data for the active monitoring of medical device performance and safety has become increasingly important. Spontaneous reports, such as those in the Food & Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), provide early warning of potential issues with marketed devices. This review synthesizes the current literature on medical device surveillance signal detection and provides a framework for application of methods to active surveillance of spontaneous reports. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically searched up to January 2019. Additionally, five methods articles from pharmacovigilance were added that had potential applications to medical devices. RESULTS: Among 105 articles included, the most common source of data (84%) was registries; median time between data collection and publication was 8 years. Surgical procedure outcome signal detection articles comprised 83% while 14% were on device outcome signal detection. The most common family of methods cited (70%) was Sequential Probability Ratio. CONCLUSION: Application of any signal detection algorithm requires careful consideration of influential factors, data limitations, and algorithmic assumptions. We recommend approaches using disproportionality, statistical process control, and sequential probability tests and provide R packages to further development efforts. The small number of published examples suggest that further development of statistical methods and technological solutions to analyze large amounts of data for device safety and performance is needed. Fundamental differences in products, data infrastructure, and the regulatory landscape suggest that medical device vigilance requires its own body of research distinct from pharmacovigilance.",

    "Title": "Wheelchair Mobility-Related Injuries Due to Inadvertent Lower Extremity Displacement on Footplates: Analysis of the FDA MAUDE Database From 2014 to 2018.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to assess reports of wheelchair mobility-related injuries from inadvertent lower extremity displacement (ILED) on footplates, which were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database during 2014-2018, characterize injury types, and evaluate MAUDE data quality. METHODS: A systematic MAUDE database review was performed. Annual reports were searched using keywords: (a) \"power wheelchair\" and \"injury\" and (b) \"mechanical (also known as manual) wheelchair\" and \"injury.\" Reports related to injuries from ILED on the footplate were reviewed. RESULTS: Reports of 1075 wheelchair injuries were found across the review period. Twenty nine (3%) met our inclusion criteria. The most common source of reports was \"manufacturer.\" The wheelchair was unavailable for evaluation in 55.17% of reports. Manufacturers' submission dates (number of days that passed after they were notified) ranged from 3 to 159. Reported injuries decreased by 60% from 2014 to 2018. The end user used a power wheelchair for all but one report. The most common injuries were single fractures, multiple fractures, wounds/cuts/infections, and amputations (in order of incidence). The most common mechanism was the foot slipping off the footplate during wheelchair mobility. CONCLUSIONS: We observed inherent weaknesses in the MAUDE database reporting process and a concerning level of reporting bias. Although there were limited reports of injuries related to ILED on the footplate during wheelchair mobility, the injuries reported were significant. More standardized reporting of the mechanism and impact of these injuries is needed to better inform wheelchair design, prescription, and patient/family education.",

    "Title": "The First 4 Years of Postmarketing Safety Surveillance Related to the MitraClip Device: A United States Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Experience.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The MitraClip (Abbott) is a commercially available device to perform percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) for patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR). Recent data support its role in appropriately selected patients with functional MR, and its use is poised to increase. However, limited safety data in \"real-world\" practice are available after market introduction. METHODS: We queried all available adverse event reports from the publicly available Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database including \"injuries\" and \"deaths\" from October 2013 (date of Food and Drug Administration [FDA] premarket approval) to September 2017 using the following search limits: brand name (\"MitraClip\") and product code (\"NKM,\" a unique FDA designation linked to MitraClip). RESULTS: During the first 4 years after FDA approval, MAUDE received 200 death reports and 1666 injury reports containing 2974 unique adverse events. Of all death reports, 21% described deaths occurring >1 year post MitraClip and 30% included limited details. The top three known causes of death included complications requiring rescue high-risk surgery, clip detachment or unsuccessful clip placement, and damage to the valvular apparatus. Similar non-fatal events were reported. Additional procedures or surgical intervention were required in 227 injury events (8%). CONCLUSIONS: While injuries reported to the FDA have steadily increased with more widespread use of TMVR, device- or procedure-related death reports have accrued more slowly, corroborating a potential institutional or operator learning curve with this device. However, in light of incomplete and poor data quality, higher-fidelity systems of postmarketing safety surveillance are needed in the evaluation of emerging devices.",

    "Title": "Temporal Trends of Urogynecologic Mesh Reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare temporal trends of urogynecologic mesh medical device reports with sentinel U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notices and to examine all linked reports of patient death. METHODS: The Reed Tech Navigator is an online tool used to extract and analyze data in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. We used FDA product codes to search for reports of synthetic mesh for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Reports with \"death\" listed as a patient event were queried further. RESULTS: There were 43,970 medical device reports involving urogynecologic mesh reported to the FDA between August 2000 and January 2019, with most occurring after the 2011 FDA communication (n=43,018, 97.8%). Of these medical device reports, 64.6% (n=28,422) were for SUI products, 27.0% (n=11,876) were for transvaginal POP products, and 8.4% (n=3,672) were for transabdominal POP products. Peak reporting occurred in 2013, which corresponded with the first major plaintiff verdicts and class action vaginal mesh settlement. There were 645 (1.5%) medical device reports of death, with 49.3% (n=318) having no cause of death identified. Only four (0.6%) could be directly attributed to the initial surgery. CONCLUSION: Since 2011, urogynecologic mesh has been the focus of thousands of medical device reports annually, although the data submitted are often incomplete. Few reported deaths are directly attributable to mesh products, and the majority lack sufficient information to draw causal conclusions. A high-quality registry is necessary to improve our understanding of the patient effect from urogynecologic mesh products.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) is an effective treatment for spasticity, and therapeutic levels may be optimized using surgically implanted pumps. Though these devices are effective, complications can pose significant challenges to patients, decreasing the therapeutic effect and potentially requiring reoperation. As such, it is critical that complications associated with ITB be effectively characterized. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cases reported during the past 3 years documenting adverse events specifically related to ITB pumps. We identified 1935 adverse events that were individually analyzed and categorized by type of complication. RESULTS: Out of the 1935 unique adverse events identified from the MAUDE database, 25.7% were device-related complications (n = 497). Of those, 50.3% were catheter-specific (n = 250), 21.3% (n = 106) were pump-specific, and 28.3% (n = 141) were included, more generally, in catheter or device erosion. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database may be a useful resource for evaluating ITB pump complications across a larger data set.

    "Abstract": "Background. Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) use has increased with newer generation implants. Current reports in the literature regarding complications use data extracted from high-volume centers. The types of complications experienced by lower-volume centers may not be reflected in these reports. The purpose of this study was to determine a comprehensive TAA adverse event profile from a mandatory-reporting regulatory database. Methods. The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was reviewed from 2015 to 2018 to determine reported adverse events for approved implants. Results. Among 408 unique TAA device failures, the most common modes of failure were component loosening (17.9%), intraoperative guide or jig error (15.4%), infection (13.7%), and cyst formation (12.7%). In addition, the percentage distribution of adverse event failure types differed among implants. Conclusion. The MAUDE database is a publicly available method that requires mandatory reporting of approved device adverse events. Using this report, we found general agreement in types of complications reported in the literature, although there were some differences, as well as differences between implants. These data may more accurately reflect a comprehensive profile of TAA complications as data were taken from a database of all device users rather than only high-volume centers.Levels of Evidence: NA.",

    "Abstract": "Robotic prostatectomy is the most commonly performed robotic procedure in the United States. Increasing utilization of this procedure necessitates characterization of robot malfunctions and associated patient injuries. We performed a review of adverse events reported to a publicly available database. We searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reported adverse events (RAE) involving the intuitive surgical system. Reports involving prostatectomy from 2014 to 2019 were extracted and analyzed for data regarding death, patient injury, and device malfunction. Of 9109 reported adverse events (RAE), 602 were extracted for robotic prostatectomy over the study period. Seven were patient deaths (1.2%), 53 (8.8%) were patient injuries (Table 1), and 542 (90.0%) were malfunctions (Table 2). Malfunctions resulted in 25 aborted cases, 21 open conversions, and 25 laparoscopic conversions (71/542, 13.1%; Fig. 1). Instrument failures comprised the majority (76.4%) of malfunctions. Seven malfunctions (1.3%) resulted in patient injury. The most common device-related injury involved the monopolar curved scissors. No reported deaths were related to robot malfunction. Instrument failures comprise majority of the malfunctions of the Da Vinci robot during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. When malfunctions do occur they are usually recoverable and rarely lead to patient injury.",

    "Title": "Device-Related Complications Associated with Magec Rod Usage for Distraction-Based Correction of Scoliosis.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent literature identifies similar failure rates such as anchor pull-out and rod breakage, but a higher unplanned revision surgery with MAGEC rods than with traditional growth rods. Besides known failure modes such as rod fracture, infection, etc., failure to noninvasively distract the rods was cited as the main cause of such unplanned surgeries. The source of these data ranges from multicenter cohort studies to singular case series. These studies included explanted implants that had undergone failure in distraction mechanism, rod fracture, or infection, or had reached their maximum length. Nevertheless, in addition to identifying the overall mode of failure, it is equally important to identify the large-scale incidence of exclusive failures in comparison with standard instrumentation failure modes in spine surgery. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) databases were searched for reports on MAGEC rods, and on standard instrumentation used for spinal fusion. The adverse events were recorded, tabulated, and analyzed. RESULTS: A search of the US FDA MAUDE database yielded reports of 163 device-related adverse events. These included distraction mechanism failure (n=129), rod fracture (n=24), and minor voluntary reports of infection and tissue discoloration (n=10). For standard instrumentation usage in spine surgery, pedicle screw breakage post surgery (n=336), set screw damage during surgery (n=257), rod breakage post surgery (n=175), interbody cage breakage during surgery (n=118), and pedicle screw breakage during surgery (n=75) were identified as the top 5 failure modes. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified the distraction mechanism failure as the most common and growing complication associated with MAGEC rod usage in children with scoliosis, leading to unplanned invasive revision surgeries.",

    "Title": "SAGES TAVAC safety and efficacy analysis confocal laser endomicroscopy.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel endoscopic adjunct that allows real-time in vivo histological examination of mucosal surfaces. By using intravenous or topical fluorescent agents, CLE highlights certain mucosal elements that facilitate an optical biopsy in real time. CLE technology has been used in different organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. There has been numerous studies evaluating this technology in gastrointestinal endoscopy, our aim was to evaluate the safety, value, and efficacy of this technology in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Technology and Value Assessment Committee (TAVAC) performed a PubMed/Medline database search of clinical studies involving CLE in May of 2018. The literature search used combinations of the keywords: confocal laser endomicroscopy, pCLE, Cellvizio, in vivo microscopy, optical histology, advanced endoscopic imaging, and optical diagnosis. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. The manufacturer's website was also used to identify key references. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) Manufacturer And User facility and Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for reports regarding the device malfunction or injuries. RESULTS: The technology offers an excellent safety profile with rare adverse events related to the use of fluorescent agents. It has been shown to increase the detection of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, gastric intraepithelial neoplasia/early gastric cancer, and dysplasia associated with inflammatory bowel disease when compared to standard screening protocols. It also aids in the differentiation and classification of colorectal polyps, indeterminate biliary strictures, and pancreatic cystic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: CLE has an excellent safety profile. CLE can increase the diagnostic accuracy in a number of gastrointestinal pathologies.",

We create MAUDE (Mean Alterations Using Discrete Expression) for quantifying the impact of guide RNAs on a target gene's expression in a pooled, sorting-based expression screen. MAUDE quantifies guide-level effects by modeling the distribution of cells across sorting expression bins. It then combines guides to estimate the statistical significance and effect size of targeted genetic elements. We demonstrate that MAUDE outperforms previous approaches and provide experimental design guidelines to best leverage MAUDE, which is available on https://github.com/Carldeboer/MAUDE.",

    "Title": "Adverse events involving hallux metatarsophalangeal joint implants: Analysis of the United States Food and Drug Administration data from 2010 to 2018.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hallux metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) is 1 in 40 people over the age of 50. Surgical treatment options for MTPJ arthritis include joint preservation, joint resurfacing, and arthrodesis. Hallux MTPJ implants have evolved over the past several decades, but are associated with various complications. The aim of this study was to examine the MAUDE database to determine reported adverse events for hallux MTPJ implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was reviewed from 2010 to 2018 to review voluntary reported adverse event reports for approved implants within the United States. We recorded the type of adverse event and excluded duplicate reports and those extracted from already published literature. RESULTS: Among 64 reported hallux MTPJ implant adverse events, the most common modes of adverse events were component loosening (34%), infection (14.1%), component fracture (9.4%), inflammation (9.4%), and allergic reaction (7.8%). Regarding implant type, Cartiva SCI had the highest percentage of adverse events (23.4%), followed by Arthrosurface ToeMotion (20.3%), Ascension MGT (12.5%), Arthrosurface HemiCAP® (10.9%), Futura primus (9.4%), and Osteomed Reflexion (6.3%). There was an increase in reported adverse events after 2016. The MAUDE database does not report the total incidence of implant insertion. CONCLUSION: Our study of the MAUDE database demonstrated that component loosening and infection are the most common modes of adverse events for hallux MTPJ implants. Cartiva accounted for one-fourth of the implant-related adverse events during our study period, followed by ToeMotion, and Ascension MGT implants. Continued reporting of adverse events will improve our understanding on short and long-term complications of various hallux MTPJ implants.

    "Title": "Death by Implants: Critical Analysis of the FDA-MAUDE Database on Breast Implant-related Mortality.",
    "Abstract": "UNLABELLED: Since the 1992 moratorium by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the debate on the association of breast implants with systemic illnesses has been ongoing. Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma has also raised significant safety concerns in recent years. METHODS: A systematic search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed to identify all cases of breast implant-associated deaths reported to the FDA. RESULTS: The search identified 50 reported cases of apparent implant-related mortality; breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma comprised the majority of fatal outcomes (n = 21, 42%), followed by lymphoma (n = 4, 8%), breast cancer (n = 3, 6%), pancreatic cancer (n = 2, 4%), implant rupture (n = 2, 4%), and postoperative infections (n = 2, 4%). Single cases (n = 1, 2% each) of leukemia, small bowel cancer, lung disease, pneumonia, autoimmune and joint disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, liver failure, and sudden death, and 2 cases (4%) of newborn deaths, to mothers with breast implants, were also identified. A literature review demonstrated that 54% of alleged implant-related deaths were not truly associated with breast implant use: the majority of these reports (82%) originated from the public and third-party sources, rather than evidence-based reports by health-care professionals and journal articles. CONCLUSIONS: Although there exists a need for more comprehensive reporting in federal databases, the information available should be considered for a more complete understanding of implant-associated adverse outcomes. With only 46% of FDA-reported implant-related deaths demonstrated to be truly associated with breast implant use, there exists a need for public awareness and education on breast implant safety.",

    "Title": "A Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Analysis of Upper Aerodigestive Endoscopy Contamination: Is Flexible Laryngoscopy Different?",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Several recent studies have observed a high incidence of duodenoscope microbial contamination and an association of contamination with healthcare-acquired infections. This study sought to quantify nasopharyngoscope microbial contamination relative to that of other endoscope categories and characterize the manufacturers, outcomes, and microbial profiles associated with these cases. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 3,865 adverse events were collected from 2013 to 2019 using the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. The fraction of total device failures associated with contamination was quantified for nasopharyngoscopes, bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, and gastroscopes. Odds ratios of nasopharyngoscope contamination compared to that of bronchoscopes, duodenoscopes, or gastroscopes were calculated, and significance was assessed by χ2 analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonparametric testing of significance. RESULTS: Nasopharyngoscope device failures were reported at an incidence of 0.646 per month; 34.1% involved contamination, comparable to the frequency observed for bronchoscopes (23.4%, P = .118), duodenoscopes (29.2%, P = .493), and gastroscopes (45.3%, P = .178). The frequency of device contamination was observed to be significantly higher for a particular endoscope manufacturer regardless of endoscope category (Kruskal-Wallis P = .021). In instances of contamination, nasopharyngoscopes were significantly less associated with patient harm or death than bronchoscope (odds ratio [OR] = 10.2) and duodenoscope (OR = 4.81) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rates of contamination were comparable across all endoscope categories, nasopharyngoscope contamination was less commonly associated with patient harm or death. In an era of rising healthcare costs, determining adequate disinfection standards for nasopharyngoscopes and their impact on patient safety is crucial.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare reports of implant fatigue failure submitted to the FDA of 2 commonly used cephalomedullary nails. METHODS: In total, 2724 medical device reports from the FDA's MAUDE database from Jan 2015 to Oct 2019 were reviewed for the Trochanteric Femoral Nail-Advanced (TFNa) and Gamma 3 implants. RESULTS: Data from 342 implant failures included in the MAUDE database were analyzed. TFNa and Gamma 3 had 183 and 159 reported fatigue failures, respectively. All failed implants fractured in the same location through the proximal screw aperture. Time from implantation to failure was on average 2 months shorter for TFNa implants that were reported fractured than for Gamma 3 implants reported, a difference that was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In total, 100 implants were reported to have failed within the first 4 months (53 and 47 for TFNa and Gamma 3, respectively). For Gamma 3 implants that failed in the first 4 months, almost all of the available manufacturers' inspection reports revealed implant notches at the point of failure from drilling. For TFNa implants that failed early, only one reported notch was noted in the available inspection reports. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other studies regarding fatigue failure, reported failures in both TFNa and Gamma 3 occurred earlier than can be attributed to delayed or nonunion. The reported failures of the TFNa in the MAUDE database occurred earlier than did those of the Gamma 3. Early failures of the Gamma 3 seemed to be the result of iatrogenic implant notching.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Implantable hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) has been found to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with obstructive sleep apnea, and patient adherence to treatment has been found to be as high as 86% after 12 months of therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to review the medical device reports (MDRs) submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Device Facility Experience (MAUDE) database to identify adverse events related to HNS therapy that could hinder compliance. METHODS: A search of the FDA MAUDE database was conducted using the product code \"MNQ\" for \"Inspire stimulator for sleep apnea.\" Reports of adverse events associated with Inspire for sleep apnea from January 2000 to May 2020 were included for analysis. From these included reports, event variables were collected, including event setting, adverse event to patient, iatrogenic injury, device malfunction, interventions, and root causes. Results were compiled and reviewed. RESULTS: The search query yielded 180 reports that met inclusion criteria, containing a total of 196 adverse events. The most commonly reported adverse events to patients were infection (n = 50, 34.2%), neuropraxia (n = 22, 15.1%) and hematoma/seroma (n = 17, 11.6%). A total of 83 adverse events (42.3%) required reoperation. The most common reoperations performed for adverse events to patients were explantation (n = 30, 46.2%) and device repositioning/lead revision (n = 24, 36.9%), while the most common reoperation performed for device malfunctions was device replacement (n = 10, 55.6%). CONCLUSION: In attempting to further improve patient compliance, understanding these device malfunctions and adverse events related to HNS implantation or usage is crucial for the identification of potential causes of patient non-adherence.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Surgical lasers are used extensively in head and neck surgery. Laser use in the upper airway offers many advantages but also presents risks to patients and operators that are not reported comprehensively. This study aims to summarize device malfunctions, patient complications, and subsequent interventions related to laser use in the upper airway. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of surgical laser adverse events from January 2010 to March 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to the upper airway. RESULTS: Sixty-two reports involving upper airway laser use in an operating room were identified, from which 95 events were extracted. Of these, 40 (42.1%) were adverse events to patients, 2 (2.1%) adverse events to operators, and 53 (55.8%) device malfunctions. Dislodgement of laser fiber in the airway (23 [57.5%]), burn (8 [20%]), and scar (5 [12.5%]) were the most common adverse events to patients. Two incidents of eye exposure through unfiltered microscope lenses were the only adverse events to operators. Fiber break (26 [49.1%]) and flare (12 [22.6%]) were the most common device malfunctions. DISCUSSION: Surgical lasers have demonstrated utility in head and neck surgery but are associated with risks. This study discusses adverse events and device malfunctions associated with airway laser surgery and emphasizes shortcomings in current reporting. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Standardized reporting and multi-institutional research are needed to better understand adverse events related to surgical laser use and to allow accurate estimation of their prevalence.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with tracheoesophageal voice prostheses from 2010 to 2020: A MAUDE study.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Tracheoesophageal puncture with voice prosthesis placement remains the gold standard for voice restoration following total laryngectomy, but may cause various complications. This study aims to summarize patient-related and device-related adverse events associated with tracheoesophageal puncture and voice prosthesis placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of adverse events related to tracheoesophageal puncture with voice prosthesis placement from January 1, 2010, to April 30, 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to tracheoesophageal prostheses. RESULTS: Seventy-seven reports involving tracheoesophageal voice prostheses were identified, from which 111 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 58 (52.3%) were patient-related, while 53 (47.7%) were device-related. The most frequently reported patient-related adverse events were aspirated prosthesis (24 [41.4%]), foreign body during placement (11 [19.0%]), aspiration pneumonia (9 [15.5%]), and aspirated brush tip (8 [13.8%]). The most common device-related adverse events were detached brush tip (15 [28.3%]), leak (14 [26.4%]), and torn esophageal flange (11 [20.8%]). CONCLUSIONS: While tracheoesophageal puncture with voice prosthesis placement has revolutionized voice rehabilitation following total laryngectomy, the procedure may be associated with adverse events both at the time of placement and later. Interventions aimed at improving both physician and patient education may help reduce adverse events attributed to improper use. Further research is needed to clarify optimal approaches to education.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The results supporting Cartiva, a synthetic cartilage implant (Wright Medical) in hallux rigidus have come from limited institutions creating observational bias. Complications experienced in community centers are not routinely included in the published literature. To look at a broader range of potential complications, we reviewed the United States Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) voluntary device database and compared that data with published literature. Methods: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the FDA was retrospectively reviewed between July 2016 and October 2019 using the product code: PNW, assigned for Cartiva. Results: A total of 49 events have been reported and implant subsidence was the most common with 16 reports. Others include fragmentation (9), infection (4), bone erosion (3), foreign body reaction (1) and unspecified (16). Thirty-five events mentioned further surgeries at a mean interval of 4.75 months. Conclusions: The analysis of the MAUDE database disclosed certain device-related dysfunctions that have been underreported in the published literature. Because of the voluntary nature of reporting, the true incidence of each complication is unknown with this data representing a baseline. The MAUDE database could be further strengthened by a more robust reporting mechanism or mandatory reporting of device-related complications.Levels of Evidence: Level IV: Case series from large database analysis.",

    "Title": "Vaginal laser treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause: does the evidence support the FDA safety communication?",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a chronic, progressive condition frequently manifesting as vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. Survey data indicate this is a highly prevalent, likely underreported, condition that profoundly affects quality of life for millions of women. Vaginal lasers demonstrate promise as an effective, nonhormone therapeutic alternative for GSM; however, the risks associated with them may have been overstated. OBJECTIVE: Despite reports of improved sexual and vaginal comfort without serious safety concerns, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a 2018 safety communication warning against it. We conducted a systematic literature review and surveyed both the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) and Bloomberg Law Databases to evaluate risks associated with laser treatment for GSM. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic literature review identified articles published before September 2019. The MAUDE database was searched by name from 2009 to 2019 for safety claims for 24 vaginal laser devices. The Bloomberg Law database was searched for product liability claims against any vaginal laser device manufacturer before July 2019. FINDINGS: Literature review revealed 3 publications detailing 29 presumptive laser-associated complications, only 5 of which (17.2%) reported worsening symptoms after treatment. The MAUDE database contained 120 complaints; only 30 (25%) detailed potential adverse patient events, most frequently pain (n = 12) and burning (n = 10). The Bloomberg law database contained no claims asserting harm from device use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Lacking strong evidence indicating significant patient risk for vaginal laser treatment of GSM, the FDA safety communication appears unsubstantiated and implies gender bias. Identified complications suggest most reported \"adverse events\" represent lack of treatment effect. The well-documented benefits and low risk of adverse event suggest laser therapy for GSM is reasonable with appropriate pretreatment counseling. Additional randomized, well-controlled clinical trials are needed to further elucidate both the safety and efficacy of this nonhormone therapy.",

    "Title": "Electromagnetic interference on cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators during endoscopy as reported to the US Federal Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: More than 3 million patients have a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) such as a pacemaker or implanted cardioverter-defibrillator in the USA. These devices are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) leading to malfunction and injury. Radiofrequency energy, the most common modality for obtaining hemostasis during endoscopy, is the most common source of EMI. Few studies have evaluated the effect of endoscopic radiofrequency energy on CIEDs. We aim to characterize CIED dysfunction related to endoscopic procedures. We hypothesize that EMI from endoscopic energy can result in patient injury. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for CIED dysfunction related to electrosurgical devices over a 10-year period (2009-2019). CIED dysfunction events were identified using seven problem codes (malfunction, electromagnetic interference, ambient noise, pacing problem, over-sensing, inappropriate shock, defibrillation). These were cross-referenced for the terms \"cautery, electrocautery, endoscopy, esophagus, colonoscopy, colon, esophagoscopy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\" Reports were individually reviewed to confirm and characterize CIED malfunction due to an endoscopic procedure. RESULTS: A search for CIED dysfunction resulted in 43,759 reports. Three hundred and eleven reports (0.7%) were associated with electrocautery, and of these, 45 reports (14.5%) included endoscopy. Ten reports involving endoscopy (22%) specified upper (3, 7%) or lower (7, 16%) endoscopy while the remainder were non-specific. Twenty-six of reports involving endoscopy (58%) suffered injury because of CIED dysfunction: Of these, 17 (65%) received inappropriate shocks, 5 (19%) had pacing inhibition with bradycardia or asystole, 3 (12%) had CIED damage requiring explant and replacement, and 1 (4%) patient suffered ventricular tachycardia requiring hospital admission. CONCLUSION: The use of energy during endoscopy can cause dysfunction of CIEDs. This most commonly results in inappropriate defibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, and asystole. Patients with CIEDs undergoing endoscopy should undergo pre- and post-procedure device interrogation and re-programming to avoid patient injury.",

We found that for the 670G pump, there were more hypo events when auto mode was on than when auto mode was off. With Dexcom CGMs, users complained about inaccurate result when most results were in the B zone. With the Abbott Freestyle, the most frequent adverse event was an allergic skin reaction.",

    "Title": "Creating a database for health IT events via a hybrid deep learning model.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The use of poorly designed and improperly implemented health information technology (HIT) may compound risks because it can disrupt established work patterns and encourage workarounds. Analyzing and learning from HIT events could reduce the risks and improve safety but are limited by accessible HIT event reports. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning model to identify HIT event reports from the FDA resource and thus establish the first publicly accessible database for HIT event reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6994 samples (3521 HIT and 3473 non-HIT events) extracted from the FDA MAUDE database were employed to assess nine individual and 120 hybrid models on the task of HIT identification. The optimal model was evaluated on an independent dataset prior to its application for establishing the HIT event database. RESULTS: The hybrid model consisting of logistic regression, CNN, and Hierarchical RNN (ACC = 0.903, AUC = 0.954, F1 score = 0.876) is superior to all the other models. The causes of errors include lack of root cause (72.3%), short descriptions (19.7%), and model undertrained (8.0%). The accuracy of the hybrid model on an independent dataset is reported as 0.862. We applied the optimal model to the entire MAUDE database (1991-2018) and generated an HIT event database with 48,997 reports. CONCLUSION: The first HIT event database contains 48,997 reports with an annual growth rate of 10% (~5000 reports). The strategy of HIT event identification and establishment of the database could help healthcare professionals describe, understand, integrate the events and propose solutions in the context of a fuller spectrum of HIT events.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to provide a United States perspective on alloplastic total joint replacement. We sought to estimate the inpatient burden and report the most common adverse events using two administrative datasets. The National Inpatient Sample was queried from October 2015 to December 2016 for total joint replacement admissions using International Classification of Diseases 10th revision codes, and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience registry was queried from January 2009 to September 2019 using manufacturer brands. The combined final sample included 114 inpatient admissions and 392 adverse events. Mean age was 43.1 years, and most patients were white (82.7%) and female (86.0%). The mean hospital charge was $108,709.43 and the mean length of stay was 2.6 days. The most common adverse events were infection (26.3%), heterotopic bone (20.9%), and poor intraoperative fit (14.0%). Fifty-four percent of cases had bilateral total joint replacements, 24.6% had simultaneous subcutaneous abdominal fat grafting, and 11.4% had simultaneous maxillary repositioning. Fat grafting and maxillary repositioning were not associated with any significant difference in the length of stay or cost. Compared to unilateral cases, bilateral total joint replacements carried significantly greater charges (P<0.01), but no increased length of stay (P=0.70), suggesting that bilateral and unilateral cases may experience a similar postoperative course.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Implantable Dopplers (IDs) are widely used for postoperative free flap vascular monitoring. However, IDs may contribute to free flap complications or failure and better understanding of device malfunctions is needed. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for all reports of ID adverse events from two leading manufacturers (Cook Vascular and Synovis Life Technologies) in free flap surgery from January 2010 to March 2020. Reports were reviewed and categorized. A comparison of reoperations within select categories was performed using Chi-square analysis. RESULTS: Of 209 included reports, the most common device malfunctions were venous anastomotic coupler misalignment (35.4%) and coupler ring detachment (24.4%). Synovis devices were used in 100% of reports of vessel compression and Cook Vascular devices were used in 77.7% of reports of probe detachment. Of 74 patient-related adverse events, the most common were reoperation (47.3%) and vessel occlusion (28.4%). Of five reported events of flap failure, two were associated with loss of ID signal. The proportion of Doppler signal loss events leading to reoperation was significantly greater than the proportion of any other Doppler-related event leading to reoperation. Intraoperative coupler replacement was the most commonly reported intervention (n = 86), and venous anastomosis with hand-suturing occurred in 30 device malfunctions. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a variety of ID-related malfunctions. One-third of device malfunctions were associated with patient complications, and false-positive Doppler signal loss contributed substantially to the requirement of surgical re-exploration. These are important considerations for surgical teams utilizing IDs in free tissue transfer procedures.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events in Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator Implantation: 5-Year Analysis of the FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Use of hypoglossal nerve stimulator implantation has dramatically improved the surgical treatment of multilevel airway collapse during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Understanding causes of adverse events and their impact on patients undergoing stimulator implantation will help improve patient preparation and surgical practices to avoid future complications. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a retrospective review of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, a publicly available voluntary reporting system. SETTING: National patient event database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for reports associated with the terms \"hypoglossal nerve stimulator\" and \"Inspire,\" being the only currently FDA-approved system for upper airway stimulation for OSA. All records were searched with the events limited in dates between May 2014 and September 2019. RESULTS: A total of 132 patient reports were identified over the 5-year inclusion period, containing 134 adverse events. The reported adverse events resulted in 32 device revision procedures as well as 17 explantations. Device migration and infection were 2 of the most commonly reported adverse events. Complications not witnessed in previous large-scale clinical trials included pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and lead migration into the pleural space. CONCLUSION: Previous data have demonstrated hypoglossal nerve stimulator implantation results in reliable OSA improvement. However, a number of technical difficulties and complications still exist during the perioperative period, which should be communicated to patients during the surgical consent process.",

    "Title": "A cross-sectional analysis of 1347 complications for cervical disc replacements from medical device reports maintained by the United States Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Cervical disc replacement (CDR) has increased in popularity over the past decade based on published outcomes from FDA IDE studies with narrowly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A low rate of complications was noted in these studies. The broader complication profile for CDR in widespread clinical practice has yet to be described. PURPOSE: To outline the complications reported to the FDA regarding commonly used CDR products STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective database review PATIENT SAMPLE: Nationwide database of reported complications related to CDR products from patients across the country OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications related to CDR METHODS: We queried the MAUDE database and Alternative Summary Reporting (ASR) data files submitted between January 2005 to March 2020. The complications listed for seven FDA-approved CDR implants were analyzed. The entries in the databases were cataloged for complication type, date of entry, source of report, and whether the investigation was \"complete\". Reports that had too little information to extract relevant data were excluded. RESULTS: There were 1,517 entries identified in the MAUDE database. After removal of duplicate entries and entries without sufficient information, there were 1,347 entries analyzed. The top five complications were (1) migration of implant (338 entries, 25.2%) (2) insertion problem/failure (312 entries, 23.3%) (3) neck pain (203 entries, 15.2%) (4) heterotopic ossification (108 entries, 8.1%) and (5) radiculopathy (90 entries, 8.1%). The number of analyzed implant-related MAUDE entries and most common implant-related complication for each implant was 209 entries for insertion problem/failure for Mobi-C; 158 entries for migration of implant for ProDisc-C; 154 entries for insertion problem/failure for Bryan cervical disc; 130 entries for migration of implant for Prestige cervical disc; 49 entries for migration of implant for PCM cervical disc; 12 entries for migration of implant for M6 and 10 entries for migration of implant for Secure-C. Only 263 entries (19.5%) were deemed \"complete\". Most entries were from the manufacturer/company representative/distributor (923 entries, 70%). There were no entries related to cervical disc replacement devices within the ASR data. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database highlights complications related to CDR implants that may not be emphasized in currently published studies. It is important to understand this broad complication profile for CDR to ensure safe utilization of this new technology.",

    "Title": "Vaginal energy-based devices: characterization of adverse events based on the last decade of MAUDE safety reports.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Energy-based devices have gained momentum as minimally invasive procedures to treat both medical and cosmetic pelvic floor disorders including genitourinary syndrome of menopause, vaginal laxity, stress urinary incontinence, dyspareunia, and vulvar disorders such as lichen diseases and vestibulitis. However, the FDA recently issued a statement cautioning patients and providers that the safety and efficacy of energy-based devices for the treatment of vaginal symptoms has not been well established. Additionally, the FDA sent letters to the manufactures of energy-based devices with notifications that they could be violating the marketing standards of the FDA. The existing data on side effects is insufficient and limited to observational studies. We sought to characterize the safety events of vaginal energy-based devices by analysis of surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and specifically look at those events that occurred prior to the July 30, 2018 warning. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried between September 30, 2013 and October 31, 2019 for all vaginal energy-based devices. The incidence of safety events was reported for these devices and the most common complaints were described and characterized. Event reporting was analyzed before and after July 30, 2018. RESULTS: Forty-two unique and relevant medical device reports (MDRs) were retrieved. The Mona Lisa Touch had the highest number of MDRs (40.5%) followed by ThermiVa (16.7%) and Viveve (14.2%). Each medical device report was associated with a single patient experience and within the 42 medical device reports, there were 85 complaints. A majority of the MDR complaints (52.9%) were also indications for energy-based devices procedures, which include vaginal pain, dyspareunia, lichen sclerosis, and urinary frequency. Two-thirds of the complaints (68.2%) were related to pain, but serious adverse events such as third-degree burns (3.5%) were rare. Most of the reportable events occurred before July 30, 2018 (83.3%), but most were reported after July 30, 2018 (78.6%). CONCLUSIONS: MAUDE-reported data suggests that the majority of patient complaints after vaginal energy-based device treatment include vaginal pain, bladder pain, and urinary symptoms. This study suggests that the majority of complaints are not severe, and some may be related to progression of the disease. The few severe adverse events reported in the MAUDE database may have contributed to the FDA warning regarding energy-based devices. Recall bias after the FDA warning, as well as the potential for litigation, may have prompted an increase in adverse event reporting after July 30, 2018.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events and Modes of Failure Related to Rotational Atherectomy System: The Utility of the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Coronary artery calcification is a marker of advanced atherosclerosis and a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes. Rotational atherectomy (RA) can effectively modify calcified lesions, optimizing procedural outcomes. We interrogated the most commonly reported adverse events involving rotational atherectomy systems (Rotablator and Rotapro) by analyzing post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS/MATERIALS: We queried MAUDE from September 1, 2016, through December 31, 2019. After excluding duplicate reports, we included 363 reports for Rotablator and 63 reports for Rotapro in the final analysis. RESULTS: Percentages represent the proportion of total submitted MAUDE reports. The most commonly reported complications for Rotablator and Rotapro included dissection (2.7% and 6.3%, respectively) and perforation (4.1% and 19%, respectively). The most commonly reported device-related issues included detachment or structural damage, or both, for Rotablator (39.1%) and entrapment of the device component for Rotapro (47.6%). The most commonly damaged device component was the Rotawire, whereas the most commonly entrapped device component was the Rotaburr for both device configurations. Rotablator and Rotapro device-related complications were most commonly reported for the left anterior descending artery. CONCLUSION: An analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, RA devices are associated with important complications. Ongoing surveillance of safety profiles, patient outcomes, and failure modes of RA devices is warranted. Our analysis provides important insights into the mechanisms of failure of RA devices and associated complications but cannot verify causality.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Adverse Events Related to Impella Usage (from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience and National Inpatient Sample Databases).",
    "Abstract": "Impella devices are increasingly utilized for hemodynamic support in high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention or cardiogenic shock despite a lack of randomized clinical trial data showing clinical benefit and newer observational data suggesting harm. In this retrospective analysis, our aim was to determine the most common adverse events associated with Impella usage reported annually to the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and to estimate via the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database the number of percutaneous ventricular assist devices utilized and associated with inpatient mortality since introduction of the Impella. Among the 885 complete reports submitted to the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2019 related to Impella usage, there were 1,206 complications coded; 88.2% of reports occurred from 2016 to 2019. Among patients with adverse events reported, bleeding (32.8%), device deployment or retrieval issues (18.2%), vascular complications (15.8%), and death (12.4%) were the most common, and 7.9% of all complications were attributable to operator decision-making or technique. From 2007 to 2017 there was a >100-fold increase in percutaneous ventricular assist devices use with an increase and plateau in in-hospital mortality to 31% from 2012 to 2016 based on NIS data. In conclusion, Impella use has increased substantially over the last decade but remains associated with high inpatient mortality and serious complications based on data from the NIS and MAUDE databases. These findings emphasize the need for high quality randomized controlled trials to determine the clinical utility of Impella in high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention and cardiogenic shock.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade TnA (Medtronic, n.d.) is a relatively new electrosurgical technology that is used widely in head and neck surgery (Medtronic Manuals, n.d.). This study aims to summarize device malfunctions, patient complications, and subsequent interventions related to PEAK PlasmaBlade TnA during tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of PlasmaBlade TnA adverse events from June 6, 2009, to August 30, 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. RESULTS: 128 reports were identified, from which 163 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 23 (14.6%) were related to patients, and 140 (85.4%) were related to device malfunction. The most frequently reported patient-related adverse event was a burn injury (17 [73.9%]). The most common device malfunctions were dislodgment of device component (39 [27.9%]), followed by tip ignition (32 [22.9%]), damaged tip or wire during operation (28 [20%]), and melted device (24 [17.1%]). CONCLUSIONS: PEAK PlasmaBlade TnA have demonstrated utility in tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy but are associated with adverse events. Interventions aimed at improving both physician and patient education may help reduce adverse events attributed to improper use. Further study is needed to clarify optimal approaches to education.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modern intrathecal drug delivery systems (IDDS) are technologically advanced to deliver medication through various automated and patient-controlled programs. They also are associated with unique complications ranging from post-operative complications, medication-related adverse events (AE), device malfunction, to refill associated AE. OBJECTIVES: To systematically analyze real-world complications and AE reported on the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE) associated with IDDS among patients predominantly with chronic pain disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MAUDE database was sampled for a month four times a year during the study period, February 2018 to February 2019. The database was resampled every six months till August 2020 to evaluate for any additional reported cases during the index months. The two FDA approved IDDS, were included. AE were broadly classified into causes related to catheter malfunction, pump malfunction, biologic, and medication-related AE. RESULTS: A total of 1001 reports were included in the final analysis. The top three reasons for adverse report are infection/erosion (15.7%, n = 157), motor stall (12.4%, n = 125) and adverse medication reactions (11.8%, n = 119), respectively. There were five deaths among patients with IDDS. Epidural hematoma (n = 3) after IDDS surgery resulted in a death and residual neurological deficits after surgical evacuation. Programming errors, medication concentration discrepancy, and failure to turn on the pump after reprogramming are various preventable causes of medication-related IDDS AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of AE associated with IDDS from the MAUDE database provided a real-world perspective different from reported registry complications. Awareness and vigilance of preventable IDDS-related complications is the first step toward mitigating risks to provide safe and effective intrathecal drug delivery for chronic pain management.",

    "Title": "Characterization of Device-Related Malfunction, Injury, and Death Associated with Using Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Local Anesthetics in the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize medical device reports about elastomeric pumps delivering local anesthesia made to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical device reports submitted to MAUDE from January 2010 to July 2018. A systematic, computerized algorithm was used to identify records pertaining to elastomeric pumps using local anesthesia. Included records indicated the use of local anesthesia or were determined to involve the use of local anesthetics (if they did not contain specific information on drug use). Reports were analyzed within the MAUDE event type categories of malfunction, injury, death, other, and missing. Possible cases of liver injury or surgical site infection were also identified. Manual review of narratives provided in MAUDE was performed by 2 reviewers to identify possible or probable cases of local anesthetic system toxicity (LAST). RESULTS: From a pool of 384,285 reports about elastomeric pumps from the MAUDE database, 4093 met inclusion criteria for involving elastomeric pumps to deliver local anesthetics, with the peak number of reports occurring in 2014. Of these identified reports, 3624 (88.5%) were categorized as malfunctions, 292 (7.1%) as injuries, and 8 (0.2%) as involving death. We identified 13 cases (0.3%) of possible liver injury and 51 cases (1.2%) of possible surgical site infection; 139 reports (3.4%) were determined to be probably (n=53) or possibly (n=86) associated with LAST. CONCLUSION: Malfunction of elastomeric pumps delivering local anesthetics leaves patients vulnerable to injury or death. Our study indicates that reports of malfunction, injury, and death have been reported to the MAUDE database. These reports likely reflect an underrepresentation of cases in the real-world population, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive medical device reporting.",

    "Title": "Real-World Experience of the MANTA Closure Device: Insights From the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The MANTA vascular closure device (VCD) is the first commercially available dedicated closure device for large-bore femoral arterial access-site closure and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2019. Real-world data on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with the MANTA closure device are limited. We analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for the MANTA VCD (Teleflex, Wayne, Pennsylvania). METHODS/MATERIALS: Post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database from February 2019 through March 2020 were analyzed, yielding 170 reports. RESULTS: Of the 170 reports of major complications involving MANTA devices, 141 reports involved either injury (136) or death (5) related to the device. Of the 141 reports, bleeding was the most common adverse outcome described (45), followed by vessel occlusion (30) and vessel dissection (21). Device malfunction incidents (29 reports) were reported in 4 main categories: failed deployment (16 reports), malposition of the collagen (9), insufficient information (3), and device dislocation (1). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, the MANTA VCD was found to be associated with complications, including death, vascular injury, and difficulties with the device itself. Ongoing user education, proctoring, and pre-procedural patient selection are important to minimize risks associated with the MANTA VCD.",

    "Abstract": "Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) using the da Vinci Surgical system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2009. Currently, most available safety information on TORS procedures describes adverse events occurring in the context of clinical trials or series at high-volume academic centers. The goal of this study was to catalog reported adverse events associated with the da Vinci device in head and neck procedures by querying an FDA database. A search was performed on the MAUDE database inspecting for TORS safety incident reports generated from January 2009 through May 2020 using key words \"da Vinci\" and \"Intuitive Surgical\". A total of 3312 medical device records were produced. Of these 36 head and neck adverse events, reports were identified through manual screening of the data by the authors. Death was found to be the most common adverse event reported overall, manifesting in 44% of all reported incidents. The most frequent source of mortality was found to be hemorrhaging in the perioperative period rather than incidents of device malfunction or structural damage from surgery. This was found to be similar to the results of other published series for transoral ablative surgery. This study suggests that the small number of reported adverse events related to TORS with the da Vinci system seems to mirror what would be expected from the same procedures using other methods for transoral surgery.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for suture-based vascular closure devices (VCDs) - Perclose ProGlide (Abbott, Chicago, Illinois) and Prostar XL (Abbott). BACKGROUND: Suture-based VCDs are mostly used for large-bore femoral arterial access-site closure. Real-world, contemporary experience on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with these devices is limited. METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database, for the ProGlide system and for the Prostar XL system, were analyzed, yielding 827 Perclose ProGlide reports and 175 Prostar XL reports. RESULTS: Of the 827 reports of major complications involving the Perclose ProGlide devices, 404 reports involved injury, and one involved death related to the device. In the Prostar XL analysis, 94 reports involved injury, and one involved death. Bleeding from vessel injury was the most common adverse outcome described with both devices, followed by hematoma and thrombus. Surgical repair was the most commonly used treatment strategy. In terms of device malfunction, suture-related malfunction (212 reports) was most commonly seen in the Perclose ProGlide group, while failed deployment was most commonly seen in the Prostar XL group. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in real-world practice, suture-based VCDs were found to be associated with complications, including vascular injury, difficulties with the device itself, and even death. Ongoing user education and pre-procedural patient selection are important to minimize risks associated with suture-based vascular closure devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The published outcomes of total ankle replacement (TAR) implants came from limited institutions creating observational bias. For broader perspective, we queried the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) voluntary database to explore complications reported outside published literature. METHODS: The database was reviewed retrospectively between November 2011 and April 2019 using two product codes assigned to six TAR devices. RESULTS: Among 648 relevant reports available in the database, common complications were aseptic loosening (19.3%), infection (18.2%), and alignment/mechanical issues (16.5%). Others included instrument/instrumentation complications, impingement, polyethylene problems, fractures, avascular necrosis of talus (AVN), and packaging issues. CONCLUSION: MAUDE database revealed various patterns of device-related malfunctions that have been under-reported in published data. Despite inconsistency in the available reports, it provided opportunities for improvements in quality control, device design, and ultimately patient safety. Database would be further strengthened by more robust reporting mechanism or mandatory reporting of device-related complications.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the rates of endovascular stapler complications during hilar ligation in minimally invasive radical nephrectomy over the last 10 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 1, 2009 to August 1, 2019. Staplers were categorized according to type, namely Ethicon Inc. endocutters (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick NJ); Endo-GIA (Medtronic, Minneapolis MN); and Endo-TA (Medtronic, Minneapolis MN). RESULTS: There were 383 cases of complications involving staplers, 63% with Ethicon endocutters; 28% with GIA; and 9% with TA. 22 deaths (5.7% of total complications) were attributed to staplers. No deaths or reoperations occurred due to TA staplers. TA staplers were also associated with a reduced incidence of conversion to open as compared to Ethicon and GIA staplers. Apart from one device, manufacturer evaluation of returned devices either showed no abnormalities or attributed fault to improper use of staplers. DISCUSSION: We characterized stapler complications during a 10-year period for minimally invasive radical nephrectomy. No deaths or reoperations occurred due to TA staplers, perhaps due to cutting and stapling occurring in separate steps. Based on manufacturer evaluation attributing stapling malfunctions to human errors, training of operating room staff on proper use of these devices is critical to prevent potentially significant complications from occurring.",

    "Title": "A systematic review of the quality of cardiovascular surgery studies that extracted data from the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate opportunities and limitations of using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for cardiovascular surgery research, we analyzed the quality of studies having ever used MAUDE, in the field of cardiovascular surgery. METHODS: We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for randomized and nonrandomized studies, from inception to July 2019. Two authors evaluated the quality of the retrieved observational studies, according to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for either case series or cross-sectional studies. These tools quantify the quality of case series and cohorts/cross-sectional studies, respectively, with nine and 14 queries. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were included in the final qualitative review. Of 58 identified studies, 32 were case series, 8 were abstracts of case series, and 13 were reviews or case discussion with an included series from MAUDE. Also, five articles were cross-sectional studies. Of the 32 formal case series, 26 (81%) were found to have poor quality. The most common reasons for a poor quality designation included a lack of consecutive participants, undetermined comparability of participants, and undetermined follow-up adequacy. Only one out of five cross-sectional studies had fair quality; four others were evaluated as poor quality studies. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular surgery studies using the MAUDE database, whether case series or cross-sectional design, are mostly of poor quality. Their low quality is partly caused by poor study design, but mainly by intrinsic limitations to the MAUDE database: cases recruited are not consecutive; patient characteristics are not detailed enough to allow a meaningful comparison of patient characteristics between different patient entries; outcome measures are unclear; there is a limited follow-up; and time-to-event data are lacking. We conclude that the quality of cardiovascular surgery publications that rely on data from MAUDE could be improved if investigators were to extract all relevant data points from MAUDE entries, then apply standard quality assessment tools in compiling and reporting the data. MAUDE might be improved if it used medical case report standards during the process of reporting and indexing adverse events. To calculate the incidence rate of any adverse event, all event-free cases, as well as all adverse events in patients using a device, are required. Neither of these two variables is available in the MAUDE at the time of writing.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The collagen-based MANTA device (Teleflex, PA, USA) is used for closure of large-bore vascular access. There is a paucity of data on complications associated with its use in a real-life setting. METHODS: We queried the \"Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\" MAUDE database between February 2019 and December 2020 for reports on MANTA device. RESULTS: We identified 250 reports in the MAUDE database from February 2019 through December 2020. The most common failure complication of MANTA is persistent bleeding (48.8%) and vessel occlusion or stenosis (29.6%). Most complications were managed successfully with an endovascular approach (48.4%), but a high number of patients required surgical intervention (40.4%). The most commonly reported failure mechanism was the failure of deployment (22%) followed by subcutaneous deployment (7.6%), intraluminal deployment (4.8%) amd detachment of collagen (2.8%). Access site infection was rare (1.2%). The 18 Fr. MANTA was associated with a lower risk of failure of deployment compared with the 14 Fr. device but was associated with a higher risk of vessel occlusion or stenosis (32.4% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.04) and thrombosis (11.6% vs 0%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The most common complication of the MANTA device reported to the MAUDE registry was persistent bleeding (48.8% of reports) followed by vessel occlusion (29.6%). These complications were managed successfully using an endovascular approach in 48.4% of the reports.",

    "Abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has evolved into an approved and efficacious treatment for movement, obsessive-compulsive, and epilepsy disorders that are refractory to medical therapy, with current investigation into other disease conditions. However, there are unintentional and intentional sources of external electromagnetic interference (EMI) that can lead to either malfunctioning or damaged DBS devices, as well as injury to human tissue. Comprehensive studies and guidelines on such topics in the medical literature are scarce. Herein, we review the principles behind EMI, as well as the various potential sources of interference, both unintentional (e.g. stray EMI fields) and intentional (e.g. MRI scans, \"brainjacking\"). Additionally, we employ the Manufacturer and User Device Facility Experience (MAUDE) database to assess real-world instances of EMI (e.g., airport body scanners, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electrosurgery) affecting DBS devices commonly implanted in the United States (US).",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with Bonebridge and Osia bone conduction implant devices.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Active transcutaneous Bone Conduction Implants (BCIs) are relatively new to the market and may offer improved outcomes while reducing skin-related complications associated with previous models. The purpose of this study is to examine medical device reports (MDRs) submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Device Facility Experience (MAUDE) database to identify adverse events with the active, transcutaneous BCIs, Bonebridge and Osia. METHODS: A search of the FDA MAUDE database was conducted using product code \"PFO\" (for Active Implantable Bone Conduction Hearing System), brand names \"Bonebridge\" and \"Osia.\" Data was collected on device malfunction, patient injury, inciting events, and subsequent interventions between July 1, 2018 and November 1, 2020. RESULTS: The search query yielded 83 reports that met inclusion criteria, 56 regarding Bonebridge and 27 regarding Osia. A total of 91 adverse events were reported, including 45 device malfunctions and 46 patient injuries. Of all adverse events reported for Bonebridge, 15 (26.3%, 15/57) documented patient injuries, while the majority (73.7%, 42/57) documented device malfunctions. Of all adverse events reported for Osia, 3 (8.8%, 3/34) were reported concerning malfunctions, while 31 (91.2%, 31/34) were reported for patient injuries. The most commonly reported adverse events included lack of conduction or hearing (n = 26, 28.6%), infection (n = 14, 15.4%), and intermittent or reduced conduction or hearing (n = 12, 13.2%). From the MAUDE database reported adverse events and the total number of Osia implants given to us from Cochlear over this 28 month period, we estimate patient injuries to occur in roughly 2.1% of patients. CONCLUSION: There are limitations to the database which make systemic analysis challenging. This study suggests that patients with transcutaneous, active BCIs may be experiencing fewer soft tissue injuries, but similar device malfunctions as those with previous models.",

    "Title": "Major adverse clinical events associated with implantation of a leadless intracardiac pacemaker.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leadless intracardiac pacemakers were developed to avoid the complications of transvenous pacing systems. The Medtronic Micra™ transcatheter pacemaker is one such system. We found an unexpected number of major adverse clinical events (MACE) in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database associated with Micra implantation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe these MACE and compare them to implant procedure MACE in MAUDE for Medtronic CapSureFix™ active-fixation transvenous pacing leads. METHODS: During January 2021, we queried the MAUDE database for reports of MACE for Micra pacemakers and CapSureFix leads using the simple search terms \"death,\" \"tamponade,\" and \"perforation.\" Reports from 2016-2020 were included. RESULTS: The search identified 363 MACE for Micra and 960 MACE for CapSureFix leads, including 96 Micra deaths (26.4%) vs 23 CapSureFix deaths (2.4%) (P <.001); 287 Micra tamponades (79.1%) vs 225 tamponades for CapSureFix (23.4%) (P <.001); and 99 rescue thoracotomies for Micra (27.3%) vs 50 rescue thoracotomies for CapSureFix (5.2%) (P <.001). More Micra patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (21.8% vs 1.1%) and suffered hypotension or shock (22.0% vs 5.8%) than CapSureFix recipients (P <.001). Micra patients were more likely to survive a myocardial perforation or tear if they had surgical repair (P = .014). CONCLUSION: Micra leadless pacemaker implantation may be complicated by myocardial and vascular perforations and tears that result in cardiac tamponade and death. We estimate the incidence is low (<1%). Rescue surgery to repair perforations may be lifesaving. MACE are significantly less for implantation of CapSureFix transvenous ventricular pacing leads.",

METHODS: General surgery device product code categories in MAUDE and ASR from 1999 to 2018 were identified. Changes in the rates of categories and adverse events were evaluated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: There were 283,308 (72%) general surgical device malfunctions in MAUDE and 109,954 (28%) in ASR. Reports increased annually in ASR versus MAUDE, particularly for surgical staplers and clip devices (p < 0.05). ASR contained approximately 80% of these reports; MAUDE 20%. In MAUDE, 42.9% of surgical device malfunctions and 20.2% of stapler/clip malfunctions resulted in patient injury or death. ASR listed no injury or death information. CONCLUSIONS: ASR contained a significant portion of surgical device malfunctions hidden from public scrutiny. Access to such data is essential to safe surgical care.",

    "Title": "Is fluoride varnish safe?: Validating the safety of fluoride varnish.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fluoride varnish is widely used in dentistry as a caries preventive measure with recommendations for its use even in infants. In addition, nondental providers are also applying varnish on children's teeth in various settings. However, there are questions from these nondental providers as to the safety of fluoride varnish. METHODS: To evaluate and describe the adverse events (AEs) related to fluoride varnish, the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was used. AEs reported for the dental product code for \"varnish, cavity,\" \"varnish,\" and \"fluoride\" were evaluated. The identified AEs were then reviewed and categorized using appropriate key words for the various signs and symptoms, outcomes, and treatment. RESULTS: Over the 10-year period, only 65 AEs were reported for fluoride varnish products. Swelling (33.8%); burning, itching, or soreness (23.1%); and rash (16.9%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. The most common site reported was the lips (27.7%). The most common outcome was that the patient was taken to the hospital (18.5%) or emergency department (15.4%). No deaths were reported. The patients were treated primarily using diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Johnson & Johnson Consumer) (26.1%), followed by an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Mylan) and other forms of epinephrine (15.4%), and prednisolone (9.2%). In 16.9% of the cases with AEs there was a history of allergies. The rate of AEs is estimated to be between 0.099 and 0.105 per million for fluoride varnish. A concern is the likelihood of underreporting AEs in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread use of fluoride varnish in the United States, the number of AEs reported to the US Food and Drug Administration were few. Thus fluoride varnish can be considered a safe dental product. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Provides data on the safety of fluoride varnish that can be used by the dental profession to allay concerns by nondental providers and patients on this important caries preventive measure.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Corticosteroid-Eluting Sinus Stents: A MAUDE Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Corticosteroid-eluting stents (CESs) are increasingly used after endoscopic sinus surgery to reduce the need for revision surgery, but their use is not without risks. The objective of this study is to describe adverse events related to CESs. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database (2011-2020; Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of adverse events involving the use of CESs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including Propel, Propel Mini, Propel Contour, and Sinuva (Intersect ENT). RESULTS: There were 28 reported adverse events in total, with all events being related to the Propel family of stents and none related to Sinuva stents. Overall, 22 were categorized as patient-related adverse events and 6 as device-related events. The most common adverse event was related to postoperative infection, accounting for 39% (n = 11) of all complications. Four of these patients developed periorbital cellulitis, and 5 developed a fungal infection. The second-most common adverse event was migration of the stent, representing 21% of all complications (n = 6). Overall, 8 patients (29%) in our cohort required reintervention in the operating room, with subsequent removal of the CES. CONCLUSION: The most commonly reported adverse events were postoperative infection, including multiple cases of fungal infection, followed by migration of the stent. An increased awareness of the complications associated with CESs can be used to better inform patients during the consenting process as well as surgeons in their surgical decision making.",

Popular interspinous process spacers include X-Stop, Vertiflex and Coflex, with X-Stop being taken off market due to its adverse events profile. METHODS: A disproportionality analysis was conducted to determine whether a statistically significant signal exists in the three interspinous spacers and the reported adverse events using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database maintained by the US Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: Statistically significant signals were found with each of the three interspinous spacer devices (Coflex, Vertiflex, and X-Stop) and each of the following adverse events: fracture, migration, and pain/worsening symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies such as randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the findings.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is limited data on complications associated with the use of coronary embolic protection devices (EPDs). METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between November 2010 and November 2020 for reports on coronary EPDs: Spider FX (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) and Filterwire EZ (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA). RESULTS: We retrieved 119 reports on coronary EPD failure (Spider FX n = 33 and Filterwire EZ n = 86), most of which (78.2%) occurred during saphenous vein graft interventions. The most common failure mode was inability to retrieve the EPD (49.6%), with the filter trapped against stent struts in 76.2% of the cases. Other device complications included filter fracture (28.6%), failure to cross (7.6%), failure to deploy (7.6%), and failure to recapture the filter (3.4%). Filter fracture (54.5 vs. 29.1%) and failure to recapture (9.1 vs. 2.1%) were more commonly reported, while failure to deploy the filter (0 vs. 10.5%) was less commonly reported with the Spider-FX. CONCLUSIONS: The most common modes of failure of coronary EPDs are the failure of retrieval (49.6%), followed by the filter fracture (28.6%). When using EPDs, careful attention to the technique is essential to avoid failures and subsequent complications.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature on safety and efficacy of various transseptal puncture (TSP) needles. OBJECTIVES: To assess the reported mechanisms of failure, complications, and outcomes among the most frequently used transseptal needles in the United States. METHODS: We queried the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between January 2011 and January 2021 for reports on the most commonly used transseptal needles: NRG (Baylis Medical, Montreal, Canada), and BRK (St. Jude, Saint Paul, MN)]. The primary outcome was the mechanism of failure. Secondary outcomes included clinical consequences of device failure. RESULTS: The final analysis included 306 reports of failure/complication with TSP needles (NRG n = 70, BRK n = 236). The most commonly reported mode of failure was detachment of the needle component (i.e., clip, hub, stopcock, shaft, spring, or needle tip) (14.7% overall; 17.8% BRK; and 4.3% NRG). Among these reports, cardiac perforation was the most common complication (69.9% overall; 69.1% for BRK; and 72.9% for NRG). Pericardiocentesis was the second most commonly reported complication (45.1% overall; 48.3% for BRK; and 34.3% for NRG). The procedure was successfully completed in 33.3% of all cases (36.4% for BRK and 22.9% for NRG), while surgical conversion was needed in (13.4% overall; 14% for BRK and 11.4% for NRG) of the reports. Death occurred in 3.9% of all cases overall (3.4% for BRK and 5.7% for NRG). CONCLUSIONS: Needle detachment was the most common mode of failure, and cardiac perforation was the most common complication reported with TSP needles. Future efforts should focus on innovative TSP needle design, best practice guidelines, including role of imaging guidance, and increased TSP training.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this technologic analysis was to evaluate single-use negative pressure wound therapy (sNPWT) devices. APPROACH: Published literature regarding negative pressure wound therapy, particularly focusing on single-use or disposal devices, was reviewed. Varied features of devices currently available in the United States were drawn from use instructions published by individual manufacturers. Safety information regarding sNPWT was derived from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. CONCLUSIONS: Single-use or disposable negative pressure wound therapy devices provide a safe and effective alternative to traditional negative pressure wound therapy. These devices promote healing of select open wounds and reduce complication rates in closed surgical incisions, when used in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. They may be used in any setting, but they are designed for use in home care and may be applied as a primary treatment option or following a course of traditional negative pressure wound therapy.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this technologic analysis was to critique technologic features of devices designed to deliver negative pressure wound therapy with instillation or irrigation (iNPWT). APPROACH: Published literature regarding negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) devices with the added feature of instillation or irrigation was reviewed to provide an overview of iNPWT. Varied features of devices currently available in the United States were described based on instructions published by individual manufacturers. Safety information regarding iNPWT was derived from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. CONCLUSIONS: The additional option of instillation or irrigation available with some NPWT devices may provide clinical benefits in carefully selected patients. Advantages may be related to facilitated removal of thick exudate and necrotic tissue. Devices with instillation options are indicated for inpatient settings, with ongoing monitoring of health care professionals. A simpler device with an intermittent irrigation option may be used in the home setting, with proper supervision. More research is needed to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness and cost of the therapy.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Synthetic Male Slings: An Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: We sought to describe and analyze the adverse events associated with synthetic male slings reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: We queried the MAUDE database for all entries including the terms \"Male Sling,\" \"InVance,\" \"Virtue,\" or \"Advance\" from January 1st, 2009 to December 31st, 2018. We collected and analyzed information about the event type, date received, report source, source type, and manufacturer. We reviewed and categorized the event description text for each medical device report (MDR). RESULTS: A total of 497 adverse events related to the male sling were identified. The adverse events were classified as injury (95.4%), malfunction (4.2%), and other (0.4%). There were no deaths described. The slings involved were the Advance or Advance XP sling (69.8%), InVance (15.5%), Virtue Quadratic (12.3%), or unknown (2.4%). The 4 most common adverse events described were urinary incontinence (46.7%), sling erosion (9.1%), mechanical malfunction (8.2%), and pain/numbness (8.2%). There was no increase in the number of reports in the years following the FDA warnings for urogynecologic mesh. CONCLUSION: There was an overall modest number of MDRs related to male slings and the majority of them were reported by the manufacturer. The reporting of adverse events for male slings does not seem to be affected by the controversy and scrutiny towards transvaginal mesh and midurethral slings. Further clinical studies and more objective and detailed databases are needed to investigate the safety of these synthetic slings.",

    "Title": "Complications and Failure Modes of Polymer-Jacketed Guidewires; Insights From the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The modes of failure of coronary polymer-jacketed guidewires have received limited study. METHODS: We queried the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between January 2011 and December 2020 for reports on coronary polymer-jacketed guidewires and retrieved 254 reports. RESULTS: The most common failure mode was failure of the guidewire to cross (36.2%), followed by guidewire fracture (35%), peeling of the polymer jacket (13.8%), failure to retrieve the guidewire (13.8%), and guidewire unraveling (4.7%). Guidewire fracture was more common with soft (37.3%) compared with stiff (23.8%) guidewires. Failure of retrieval was only reported with soft guidewires (9%). Coronary perforation and dissection occurred in 19.7% and 7.9% of the reports, with more reports with stiff as compared with soft guidewires (45.2% vs. 14.6% for perforation and 21.4% vs. 5.3% for dissection). CONCLUSIONS: The most common failure modes of polymer-jacketed guidewires during percutaneous coronary intervention are failure to cross the lesion, guidewire fracture, and peeling of the polymer jacket. Coronary perforations were more common with stiff whereas wire fracture was more common with soft polymer-jacketed guidewires.",

    "Title": "Location of Superior Vena Cava Tears in Transvenous Lead Extraction.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Superior vena cava (SVC) tears are rare but potentially lethal complications associated with transvenous lead extraction. When lacerations occur, surgeons need to be prepared for an emergent response. Nonetheless, little is known about the precise whereabouts of these lesions. Understanding the location and injury patterns enables a more anticipated and targeted surgical response. METHODS: We collected data via physician interviews after an SVC laceration occurred. These physicians were identified through the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and independent physician reports of adverse events. We identified 116 reports of SVC tears between July 1, 2016, and July 31, 2018. For an SVC tear to be included in our registry, a cardiothoracic surgeon had to be physically present to confirm the injury via emergent sternotomy. In each case, the surgeon recorded the SVC injury's exact location after a repair was attempted. RESULTS: During the study period, 116 SVC tears were confirmed by sternotomy. Tears occurred in any combination of the following locations: SVC-innominate vein, body of the SVC, and SVC-right atrial junction. The majority of tears (n = 72; 62%) were located in the isolated body of the SVC, followed by the SVC-right atrial junction (n = 23;19.8%) and the SVC-innominate junction (n = 17;14.6%). Combined tears were rare, accounting for only 3.6% (n = 4) of the adverse events recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Most SVC tears occurred in the isolated body of the SVC. The second most common location was the SVC-right atrial junction. The SVC-innominate junction was the third most common location for these injuries. Combined tears were uncommon.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine voluntary reports in the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, categorize complications and assign device-related causality with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), prostatic urethral lift (PUL), and transurethral water vapor therapy (TWVT). METHODS: A review was performed using the terms \"Urolift,\" \"Rezum,\" and \"transurethral resection of the prostate\" between 01/01/2015 and 12/31/2019. Duplicate and incomplete reports were excluded. The Gupta system was used to report complications and device related causality.1 Pearson's Chi-square analysis was performed to compare minor (Level 1) versus major (Levels 2-4) complications. RESULTS: A total of 548 events were examined. After removal of duplicates (n = 60), irrelevant reports (n=65), and incomplete information (n = 14), we included 409 events (74.6%). Of the 409 events, 214 were for TURP, 112 for TWVT, and 83 for PUL. In aggregate, 39.4% of events were minor/Level 1 (n=161/409). The proportion of subjects with Level 2-4 complications versus Level 1 complications was significantly higher for PUL than TURP or TWVT [X2 (2, N = 408) = 41.4023, P < .00001]. Device causality was attributable to device malfunction in 60.4% of cases (n=247/409). CONCLUSION: Device malfunction was noted in all groups and 39.4% of these were minor (Level 1). However, the majority of PUL reports noted a Level 3 or 4 complication (50.6%, 42/83), primarily bleeding related. Previous studies have not revealed significant risk of bleeding and suggests a discrepancy between study data and real-world experience that may alter patient counseling practices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data on the mechanisms of failure of covered coronary stents [Graftmaster, PK Papyrus] are limited. METHODS: We queried the \"Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\" (MAUDE) database between August 2018 (when the PK Papyrus stent was FDA approved) and December 2020 for reports on covered coronary stents. RESULTS: We identified 299 reports in the MAUDE database (after excluding duplicates, peripheral vascular reports, and incomplete records) (Graftmaster n = 225, PK Papyrus n = 74). The most common mechanism of failure of covered stents was failure to deliver the stent (46.2%), followed by stent dislodgement (22.4%) and failure to seal the perforation (19.7%). Failure to deliver the stent was more often reported with Graftmaster compared with PK Papyrus (59.1% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001). Stent dislodgement was more often reported with PK Papyrus compared with Graftmaster (75.7% vs. 4.9%, p < 0.001) and was managed by device retrieval or by crushing the stent. CONCLUSIONS: The most common failure mechanisms of covered stents are failure of delivery, stent dislodgement, and failure to seal the perforation. Failure of delivery was more common with Graftmaster, while stent dislodgement was more common with PK Papyrus. Further improvements in covered stent design are needed to optimize deliverability and minimize the risk of complications.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Injection laryngoplasty (IL) is considered safe in both the operating room and clinical setting. However, safety data is limited to single-institution studies with reduced sample sizes. The objective of this study is to examine a national database for adverse events related to IL in an effort to further confirm the safety of this procedure and better characterize potential complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reported adverse events of IL procedures utilizing calcium hydroxyapatite (CAHA), hyaluronic acid (HA) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) implants from 2009 to 2020. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: We identified 47 reported adverse events. The average patient age was 54 years old. 59.3% of patients were female. Adverse events more frequently involved the use of CAHA compared to HA or CMC (n = 27, 57.4%, n = 13, 27.7% and n = 7, 14.9%, respectively). The most common adverse events were laryngeal edema (n = 18, 39.1%), improper placement of injected material (n = 12, 26.1%), persistent dysphonia (n = 13, 28.3%), and post-injection dysphagia or odynophagia (n = 11, 23.9%). Major events, defined as requiring emergency room treatment, hospitalization, or surgical intervention accounted for 29 (60.4%) of cases. Four cases of edema required intubation, and one patient necessitated a surgical airway. CONCLUSION: Complications arising from IL range from minor events to airway obstruction and may happen with a variety of injectable materials including CAHA, HA and CMC. Few cases of airway obstruction requiring immediate intervention were identified, confirming the safety of IL in both the operative and office setting.",

    "Abstract": "Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is an important strategy to reduce stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at high risk of bleeding on long-term anticoagulation. Real-world assessments of the safety of the Watchman LAAC device remain limited. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and timing of adverse events associated with Watchman LAAC device implants performed after FDA approval. Adverse events associated with Watchman LAAC implants performed between March 2015 and March 2019 were identified through a search of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. During the study period, 3,652 unique adverse events were identified. An estimated 43,802 Watchman implants were performed in the United States during the study period. The overall adverse event rate was 7.3% and the mortality rate was 0.4%. Of the 159 unique types of adverse events identified, pericardial effusion was most common (1.4%). Most adverse events (73%) occurred intraoperatively (59%) or within 1 day of the procedure (15%). However, 19% of deaths, 24% of strokes and 27% of device embolizations occurred >1 month after implantation. The rates of most Watchman-related adverse events reported in the MAUDE database were comparable to those observed in clinical trials. A majority of adverse events occurred within 1 day of implant. In conclusion, while the absolute event rates were low, a significant proportion of device embolizations, strokes, and deaths occurred >1 month after Watchman implant.",

    "Title": "Evolution of a novel technology for gastroesophageal reflux disease: a safety perspective of magnetic sphincter augmentation.",
    "Abstract": "Magnetic sphincter augmentation using the LINX® device is a minimally invasive surgical option for patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. An estimated 30,000 devices have been implanted worldwide. Device removals and erosion are identified risks. The objective of this analysis is to explore the procedure evolution with an emphasis on the removals and associated characteristics that may guide future clinical practice. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience and Ethicon's complaint databases were queried for all surgical device explants since January 2013. Device unit sales were used to determine the rates. The endpoint was based upon the time from implant to explant. Explant and erosion rates were calculated at yearly intervals and the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to measure the time to explant. Chi-square analyses were used to investigate the risk of explant associated with the size, geography and implant year. Overall, 7-year cumulative risk of removal was 4.81% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) CI: 4.31-5.36%). The likelihood of removal was significantly related to the device size (P < 0.0001), with smaller sizes being more likely to be explanted. The primary reasons for device removal and relative percentages were dysphagia/odynophagia (47.9%), persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease (20.5%) and unknown/other (11.2%). Overall, the 7-year cumulative risk of erosion was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.46%). The average device size increased from 14.2 beads ± 1.0 in 2013 to 15.3 beads ± 1.2 in 2019 (P < 0.001). Surgical technique and perioperative management play an important role in the outcomes. Clinical practice changes since magnetic sphincter augmentation has been incorporated into clinical use are associated with improved outcomes and should be further characterized. Smaller device size is associated with increased removal and erosion rates.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a MAUDE study.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common surgical option for the treatment of medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-compiled database of adverse event reports related to medical devices, is a public resource that can provide insight into the relative frequency of complications and patient complaints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed the MAUDE database and queried for adverse reports for deep brain stimulators implanted for PD from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018. Complaints were classified into device malfunction, patient non-compliance, patient complaint, surgically managed complications (i.e. complications that are corrected via surgery), and death. Patient complaints were further stratified into ineffective stimulation, shock, overstimulation, battery-related problems, or pain at the pulse generator site. Surgically managed complications were classified as intraoperative complications, impedance, migration, erosion, infection, lead fracture, and lead disconnection. Each event could receive multiple classifications and subclassifications. RESULTS: A total of 4,189 adverse event reports was obtained. These encompassed 2,805 patient complaints. Within this group, 797 (28%) events were classified as ineffective stimulation. There were 1,382 surgically managed complications, 104 (8%) of which were intraoperative complications, 757 (55%) documented impedance issues, 381 (28%) infections, and 413 (30%) lead-related issues. There were 53 documented deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database has potential use as a real time monitor for elucidating the relative occurrence of complications associated with deep brain stimulation. It also allows for the analysis of device-related complications in specific patient populations. Although the database is useful in this endeavor, it requires improvements particularly in the standardization of reporting adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted techniques are common across many surgical subspecialties. While robotic stapling offers increased surgeon control, there is limited information on surgical complications related to robotic stapler use. METHODS: We reviewed the FDA's MAUDE database for adverse events related to robotic stapler use. RESULTS: Upon review of the FDA database, the most frequently reported robotic stapler complications were malfunction, failure to form staple line, device fragmentation, and misfire. 31 Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher complications were attributed to stapler use since 2014. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on prevalence of robotic stapler use is needed to quantity the associated complication rate.",

    "Title": "Characterizing Complications of Deep Brain Stimulation Devices for the Treatment of Parkinsonian Symptoms Without Tremor: A Federal MAUDE Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "Introduction Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a modality of treatment for medication refractory Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients with debilitating motor symptoms. While potentially life-changing for individuals with Parkinson's disease, characterization of adverse events for these DBS devices have not yet been systematically organized. Therefore, the goal of this study was to characterize reported complications of DBS devices reported to the Food & Drug Administration over the last 10 years. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was utilized to retrieve entries reported under \"Stimulator, Electrical, Implanted, For Parkinsonian Symptoms\" between July 31, 2010 and August 1, 2020. After removing duplicate entries, each unique adverse event reported was sorted into complication categories based on the entries' provided narrative description. A final tabulation of complications was generated. Results The search query revealed 221 unique adverse events. The most common DBS devices were the Vercise Gevia, Vercise Cartesia and Vercise PC produced by Boston Scientific (Brian Walker, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). The most commonly reported complications were infection (16.2%) follow by lead migrations (8.6%). Other common causes of complications were circuit-related impedance (6.5%), cerebral bleeds (6.3%), device failure (6.3%) and device-related trauma (4.5%). Over a third (40%) of all devices reported with adverse events required returning to the operating room for explant or revision. Conclusion The most common complications of DBS systems are infections followed by lead migrations. Further research is needed to minimize infection rates associated with DBS systems and to reduce intrinsic device malfunctions for patients in the future.",

    "Title": "Reporting of Death in US Food and Drug Administration Medical Device Adverse Event Reports in Categories Other Than Death.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: In the US, most postmarket medical device safety data are obtained through adverse event reports that are submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Adverse event reports are classified by the reporter as injury, malfunction, death, or other. If the device may have caused or contributed to a death, or if the cause of death is unknown, the FDA requires that the adverse event be reported as a death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of medical device adverse event reports submitted to the MAUDE database that were not classified as death even though the patient died. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this study, a natural language processing algorithm was applied to the MAUDE database, followed by manual text review, to identify reports in the injury, malfunction, other or missing categories that included at least 1 term that suggested a patient death, such as patient died or patient expired, from December 31, 1991, to April 30, 2020, for any medical device. EXPOSURES: Manual review of a random sample of 1000 adverse event reports not classified as death and of selected reports for 62 terms that are associated with deaths but were not classified as death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Percentage of adverse event reports in which the patient was said to have died in the narrative section of the report but the reporter classified the report in a category other than death. RESULTS: The terms in the natural language processing algorithm identified 290 141 reports in which a serious injury or death was reported. Of these, 151 145 (52.1%) were classified by the reporter as death and 47.9% were classified as malfunction, injury, other, or missing. For the overall sample, the percentage of reports with deaths that were not classified as deaths was 23% (95% CI, 20%-25%), suggesting that approximately 31 552 reports in our sample had deaths that were classified in other categories. The overall percentage of missed deaths, defined as the percentage of deaths that were classified in other categories, was 17% (95% CI, 16%-19%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Many of the findings of this study suggest that many medical device adverse event reports in the FDA's MAUDE database that involved a patient death are classified in categories other than death. As the FDA only routinely reviews all adverse events that are reported as patient deaths, improving the accuracy of adverse event reporting may enhance patient safety.",

    "Title": "What Is Being Reported About Vaginal \"Lasers\"?: An Examination of Adverse Events Reported to the Food and Drug Administration on Energy-Based Devices.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: A description of energy-based genitourinary non-surgical devices (energy-based devices) safety data is outlined given their rapid adoption. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to describe adverse events for energy-based devices in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and to compare with similar devices and other subspecialty applications. We hypothesized that products with genitourinary applications had similar adverse events to dermatologic or general surgery applications. METHODS: The authors used Reed Tech Navigator to compile adverse events reports for all registered energy-based devices. Individual adverse events reports associated with (1) non-ablative, (2) fractionated, (3) unfractionated, (4) radiofrequency, and (5) hybrid laser technologies were categorized. Adverse event characteristics were compared among genitourinary applications (n = 39) and other subspecialty applications within the same devices (n = 79). RESULTS: Eighteen manufacturers were identified, which collectively manufacture 43 products with genitourinary applications. Thirty-nine genitourinary adverse events were reported and isolated to 6 manufacturers with 11 products, of which 82% (n = 32) were injuries, 15% (n = 6) were device malfunction, and 3% (n = 1) were related to improper maintenance. Local treatment reactions were the most commonly reported injury (62%, n = 21). Adverse events varied by device type, with CO2 lasers having more burns and radiofrequency devices having higher rates of sensation loss. Comparing similar technology types, genitourinary energy-based devices had the fewest adverse events reports per device in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events were reported for one-quarter of the products currently available, and most were local treatment reactions. The reporting of adverse events is equal to that of other subspecialties, suggesting similar risk profiles. Improved reporting is needed to fully evaluate the safety of individual energy-based devices.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Aquablation, prostatic urethral lift (PUL), and transurethral water vapor therapy (TWVT) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Our objective was to describe device malfunctions and complications to help guide procedural selection and performance. Materials and Methods: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was examined for reports related to the use of these three procedures for the treatment of BPH between January 1, 2015, and July 1, 2020. Reports were evaluated for device malfunctions and surgical complications using a previously described externally validated classification system developed for the MAUDE database. Chi square analysis was used for statistical comparison between groups. Results: A total of 391 adverse events were reported: aquablation (n = 102), PUL (n = 132), and TWVT (n = 157). There were 79 (78%) severe or life-threatening adverse events for aquablation vs 69 (52%) for PUL vs 24 (15%) for TWVT (p < 0.001). There were 4 cases of rectal perforation with aquablation and 25 cases of the PUL implants needing to be removed or causing a problem with a later procedure. Blood transfusion frequencies were aquablation-32 (31%), PUL-21 (16%), and TWVT-1 (1%). The most common device malfunctions were: aquablation-motion error (n = 8), handpiece fracture/attachment malfunction (n = 8); PUL-device misfire (n = 27), needle fragmentation (n = 21); TWVT-unresolvable error message (n = 19). Conclusions: In a national database, aquablation and PUL had noteworthy complications or device-related malfunctions such as rectal perforation and the improper placement or failed deployment of the PUL implants. Both patients and providers should be aware of potential risks when selecting these novel BPH treatments.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To report real-world complications associated with femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS). SETTING: Deidentified database. DESIGN: Retrospective review. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was culled for adverse events involving ophthalmic femtosecond laser during cataract surgery from January 2010 to January 2020. Reports in which the narrative description was inadequate to determine the nature of the complication were excluded. Each report was reviewed for complications, which were subsequently assigned to a complication category as determined by these authors. The number of events per year was determined and compared. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and January 2020, the MAUDE database search yielded 2927 reports involving femtosecond laser, of which 1927 met inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. These reports revealed 2704 complications: 1115 capsule tears (41.2%), 329 of which required vitrectomy, 372 instances of suction loss, 321 other capsulotomy-related complications, and 432 corneal or incisional complications. Rare complications included 54 reports of miosis, 16 reports of endophthalmitis, and 4 reports of toxic anterior segment syndrome. The number of events in the MAUDE database increased year over year between 2011 and 2017, peaking in 2017 at 303 events. CONCLUSIONS: By drawing on real-world data in the MAUDE database, this study identified the complications of greatest importance in clinical practice. Surgeons should be aware of the spectrum of possible complications to best prepare for all potential outcomes and to effectively counsel patients.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Electromyogram Endotracheal Tubes in Thyroid and Parathyroid Surgery.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Thyroid and parathyroid surgeries are frequently performed with the aid of electromyogram endotracheal tubes. However, the most common adverse events have not been reported comprehensively. This study aimed to summarize the device adverse events, patient complications, and subsequent interventions related to electromyogram endotracheal tubes. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional analysis, the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for electromyogram endotracheal tube adverse events between 2010 and 2020. Data were extracted for devices used in thyroid and parathyroid surgery. RESULTS: Of 198 included reports, the most common device-related adverse events were loss of response to nerve stimulation (34.8%), cuff perforation (18.2%), and tube lumen obstruction (13.6%). Of 98 patient complications, the most common included ventilation failure (n = 50), airway trauma (n = 22), and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (n = 5). There was 1 periprocedural death reported. Reported interventions include reintubation performed in 60.1% of all device adverse events, extended hospitalization in 27.3% of airway trauma events, and 5 tracheostomies performed for ventilation failure events. Forty-one events resulted in case delays and 13 events led to aborted cases. The most reported adverse events occurred in 2018 (n = 35) and 2015 (n = 30). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly reported adverse events associated with electromyogram endotracheal tubes include loss of response to nerve stimulation, cuff perforation, ventilation failure, and airway trauma. Subsequent interventions include reintubation, tracheostomy, extended hospitalization, and aborted cases. Surgical teams should consider these adverse events when consenting patients and using these devices in thyroid and parathyroid cases.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Till date, there have been no studies that have analyzed a database to examine postmarket adverse events associated with PROPEL mometasone furoate bioabsorbable drug-eluting sinus stents. OBJECTIVE: To determine the postmarket complications associated with PROPEL mometasone furoate bioabsorbable drug-eluting sinus stents. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched for adverse events associated with PROPEL bioabsorbable drug-eluting sinus stents between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2020. Data were extracted and analyzed from medical device reports (MDRs) that involved sinus stents. RESULTS: After 47 MDRs were identified, 25 reports involving PROPEL bioabsorbable drug-eluting sinus stents were reviewed, from which 40 adverse events were recorded. Of these, there were 32 adverse events to patients and 8 device malfunctions. The most common adverse events to patients included infection (21.8%), oropharyngeal obstruction (15.6%), and headache/pain (12.5%). The most common device malfunction reported was migration and expulsion of the stent (87.5%). CONCLUSIONS: PROPEL sinus stents have been shown to be effective in preventing sinus outflow obstruction after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Both adverse events to patients and device malfunctions are reported infrequently. A more comprehensive understanding of rare postmarket complications seen with PROPEL sinus stents may further aid informed decision-making regarding their usage.",

    "Title": "Bent or broken: analysis of set screw fracture in the TFNa implant.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate set screw fracture in the Trochanteric Femoral Nail Advanced implant (TFNa, Synthes, West Chester, PA) and to identify additional mechanisms of set screw failure in the TFNa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who had experienced failure after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with the TFNa were identified. TFNa implants were explanted and inspected following revision surgery. Medical device reports (MDRs) and manufacturer's inspection reports describing similar failures for the TFNa in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database were also reviewed. RESULTS: Four set screw fractures that occurred at a level II trauma center were observed. Sixty-seven reported failures were identified in the MAUDE database for review. Twenty-eight failed implants were returned to the manufacturer for inspection with a published inspection report available for analysis. Set screw fractures can occur in the TFNa when the set screw is deployed prematurely into the proximal screw aperture prior to blade/screw insertion. The set screw can also bend and deform if it is advanced against a helical blade/lag screw that is not fully seated into position, thereby potentially compromising its function. CONCLUSION: The TFNa set screw allows for potential fracture during implant insertion leading to uncontrolled collapse, early excessive proximal femoral shortening, and rotational instability of the helical blade/lag screw. Similar failures in the TFNa can be prevented by having the surgeon inspect the proximal screw aperture after attachment of the proximal aiming aim to ensure the set screw has not been deployed prematurely.

    "Title": "Modes of failure with fractional flow reserve guidewires: Insights from the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement is commonly used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess the functional significance of coronary arterial plaques. Robust real-world data on complications and modes of failure of FFR guidewires are limited. AIM: To characterize these outcomes by analyzing the post-marketing surveillance data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for commonly used FFR guidewires. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 2010 through April 2020 for 3 FFR guidewires [PressureWireTM X (Abbott), CometTM (Boston Scientific), and VerrataTM (Philips)] by searching for the following events: \"Injury\", \"malfunction\", \"death\", and \"other\". This yielded 544 reports. After excluding incomplete reports, 486 reports were analyzed. RESULTS: Guidewire tip fracture was the most commonly reported mode of failure, in 174 (35.8%) cases followed by guidewire kinking (n = 152, 31.3%), communication failure (n = 141, 29.0%), and shaft fracture (n = 67, 13.8%). In total, 133 (27.4%) device failures resulted in patient adverse events. The most common adverse event was retained guidewire tip, in 71 (53.4%) cases, followed by freshly deployed stent dislodgment (n = 26, 19.6%) and coronary artery dissection (n = 23, 17.3%). Seven deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: FFR guidewire failures can occur because of various mechanisms and cause patient adverse events. The MAUDE database serves as an important platform for improved collaboration among clinicians, device manufacturers, and regulators to improve device performance and optimize patient outcomes. Our analysis provides mechanistic insights of FFR guidewire failure and associated adverse events but cannot verify causality or provide a comparison among different guidewires.",

    "Title": "Malfunction Events in the US FDA MAUDE Database: How Does Robotic Gynecologic Surgery Compare with Other Specialties?",
    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To review malfunction events (MEs) related to the use of the da Vinci robot reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience in the last 10 years and compare gynecologic surgery with other surgical specialties. DESIGN: A retrospective review. SETTING: Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. PATIENTS: Reports from 2010 to 2020 with keywords \"Davinci\" and \"Intuitive\". INTERVENTIONS: Report review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 679 reports included in the final analysis. Most MEs occurred intraoperatively (81.7%) and were related to robotic instrument malfunction (84.5%), and 30% required an instrument switch to complete the procedure. Conversion to open and laparoscopic surgery was required in 3.1% and 1.3% of MEs, respectively. Injury to the patient occurred in 15.6% of MEs. Of the reported injuries to patients, 6.6% were related to robotic malfunction, 49.2% to instrument malfunction, and 18% to surgeon or staff misuse of the robotic system, and 15.6% were complications inherent to the procedure, not related to the robotic system. Of all the reported MEs, 4.4% were related to robot malfunction, 1.5% to console malfunction, 73.3% to Intuitive accessory malfunction, 11.2% to other accessory malfunction, 4% to surgeon or staff misuse of robotic system, and 3% to complications inherent to the procedure. Comparison between gynecologic surgery and other surgical specialties showed that 14.4% of issues were solved intraoperatively in gynecologic surgery vs 13.7% in other specialties (p = .185). The procedure was completed robotically in 85.2% in gynecologic surgery vs 84% in other specialties, laparoscopically 4.6% vs 3.7%, and open in 10.2% vs 12.4%, respectively (p = .883). In gynecologic surgery, reported MEs were made by patients in 14.8% vs 4.8% in other specialties, manufacturer in 78.4% vs 74.2%, and operating room staff in 2.3% vs 16.1%, respectively (p = .007). Injury to patient was similar in gynecologic surgery compared with other specialties (35.1% vs 23.4%, p = .122). Gynecologic and other specialty MEs did not state the need for procedure rescheduling (0% vs 0%). CONCLUSION: Most reported robotic MEs occurred intraoperatively, were related to robotic instrument malfunctions, and required an instrument switch. Most surgeries are completed robotically, but conversion to either an open or laparoscopic approach was reported in 4.4%. Of the 114 reported injuries, 47.4% were Clavien-Dindo grade III+. There were no differences noted in patient injury between gynecologic surgery and other specialties.",

    "Title": "A cross-sectional analysis of 284 complications for lumbar disc replacements from medical device reports maintained by the United States Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar disc replacement (LDR) is a motion sparing procedure for degenerative disc disease. When compared to lumbar fusion, this procedure may reduce complications, reoperations, operative time, and length of stay. However, the extent of overall complications related to LDR has not been well defined in the literature. PURPOSE: Demonstrate the complication profile of popular LDR implants reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Nationwide database of reported complications related to LDR products from patients throughout the country. OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications related to LDR. METHODS: Data files from January 1, 2004 to April 1, 2021 were queried using the publicly accessible Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and Alternative Summary Reporting program. Three LDR (\"Charité,\" \"Prodisc-L,\" and \"Activ L\") products were analyzed for complications. Data collected included the date the reports were received by the FDA, the type of complication, complication event description, and the source of the report. The complication event description was utilized to determine the completion of the investigation. Entries with insufficient information were excluded. Complications were further divided into two categories, device and non-device related. RESULTS: A total of 431 complication entries were found between January 1, 2004, and April 1, 2021. After screening for duplicates and events with insufficient information there were 284 total complications. The total complications were then further divided into implant and non-implant related. The five most common overall complications were lumbar pain (49 entries, 17.25%), migration of implant (42 entries, 14.78%), polyethylene dislodged (37 entries, 13.0%), insertion of device problem (37 entries, 13.0%), device handling problem (12 entries, 4.22%). The most common implant related complication, along with the number of MAUDE entries for each implant was migration of implant for Charité (n=6); Migration of implant for ActivL (n=24); Polyethylene dislodged for ProdiscL (n=32). Of the 284 total complications analyzed, 86 (30.28%) of the entries were deemed \"investigation completed.\" The majority of reports were submitted from the manufacturer and company representative (66.2%, 14.8 % respectively). There were no entries related to LDR within the Alternative Summary Reporting search. CONCLUSIONS: This study outlined the complications of LDR implants from the MAUDE database which have not always been highlighted in previously published studies. The findings of this study provide insight into the potential targets for improvement in future LDR design and surgical techniques to reduce complications and ensure the safe utilization of these implants.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze post-marketing surveillance data from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for the VASCADE Vascular Closure System (Cardiva Medical Inc., Santa Clara, CA). BACKGROUND: The VASCADE Vascular Closure System is a closure device for femoral arterial and venous access-site closure that was approved by the FDA in 2013. However, post-marketing data and experience on the most commonly reported complications and modes of failure associated with the VASCADE Vascular Closure System are limited. METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database from October 2013 through March 2020 were analyzed, yielding 201 reports. RESULTS: Of the 201 reports of major complications involving VASCADE devices, 156 reports involved either injury (145) or death (11) related to the device. Of the 145 injury reports, bleeding was the most common adverse outcome described (85), followed by pseudoaneurysm (29) and pulselessness of an extremity (21). The device malfunction incidents (41 reports) were reported in three main categories, with deployment failure being the most commonly reported complication. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database demonstrates that in contemporary post-marketing practice, physicians should be well-trained and educated to use the VASCADE closure device because improper utilization is a common cause of device failure, and complications with the VASCADE device can have profound clinical implications.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The author conducted a study to determine the frequency and types of adverse events associated with endodontic ultrasonic devices as reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Endodontic ultrasonic device-related adverse events reported to the MAUDE database from January 1, 2016, to October 31, 2020, were accessed and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1258 adverse event reports were submitted to the FDA MAUDE database, as classified under FDA product code ELC (ultrasonic scaler) during the study period. Among these reports, 403 were specific to the dedicated use of the 2 main types of ultrasonic devices used in endodontic treatment: ultrasonic tip devices and irrigation-related devices. Device malfunction-associated events, consisting primarily of device breakage, comprised 393 of the 1258 adverse event reports, whereas the remaining 10 reports were identified as being patient injury-related reports. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency, root causes, and economic costs of ultrasonic tip device breakage remain largely unstudied. Ultrasonic endodontic device-related adverse events and patient injuries occurring within clinical practice may be underreported at the present time. Consequently, the risks and ultimate impacts to patients from ultrasonic endodontic device breakage, malfunction and unknown cause-related adverse events, and patient injuries during their clinical usage remain largely unknown at the present time. Eight of the 10 patient injury-related reports made to the FDA MAUDE database during the period under study, containing descriptions of varying degrees of injury severity, were associated with an irrigation-related device.",

    "Title": "A Review of Reported Adverse Events in MRI-Safe and MRI-Conditional Cochlear Implants.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study looks to examine how the development of diametric magnet cochlear implant devices (CIDs) has affected observed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-related adverse events and MRI safety measures. METHODS: A search of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was conducted using the product code \"MCM\" for \"Cochlear implants.\" Reports were included for analysis if they involved MRI in recipients of cochlear implantation. Included reports were stratified into two cohorts by year: 2010 to 2014 and 2015 to 2020, reflecting the FDA approval of diametric magnet cochlear implants in 2015. Extracted event variables included implant manufacturer, adherence to MRI protocol, patient injuries, and device malfunctions. RESULTS: The product code search query yielded a total of 27,305 reports, from which 584 reports were included for analysis. From 2010 to 2014, there were 109 adverse events and 30 pre-MRI explantations. Implant displacement was the most common device malfunction (n = 69, 87.3%), and pain was the most common patient injury (n = 16, 53.3%). From 2015 to 2020, there were 566 adverse events and 62 pre-MRI explantations. The most common device malfunction was implant displacement (n = 365, 94.6%) and pain was the most common patient injury (n = 114, 63.3%). Only 64/114 (56.1%) reports after 2015 reported adherence to the recommended MRI protocol. No adverse events occurred in patients with synchrony diametric-magnet CIDs. CONCLUSION: Despite the advent of FDA-approved MRI-safe diametric magnet devices, implanted patients are still experiencing injury, explantation, and device malfunction, and providers are reporting poor compliance with MRI safety protocols.",

    "Title": "Characterizing Adverse Events of Cranioplasty Implants After Craniectomy: A Retrospective Review of the Federal Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "Introduction Cranioplasty is performed by placing an artificial plate in place of a patient's native skull bones to repair post-craniectomy defects after trauma. Implanted materials can range from titanium to synthetic polyether derivatives and are produced by multiple manufacturers. There are few studies characterizing complications associated with these cranioplasty plates to date. We aimed to quantify and categorize complications of these devices using a national federal database. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for all entries reported under the category \"plate, cranioplasty, preformed, non-alterable\" with the additional product code GXN between the time range from September 1, 2010, to September 1, 2020. After data extraction, each of the entries was screened for duplicates and tabulated into different categories of complications. Additionally, product information such as the plate manufacturer was extracted from each entry. Results The search yielded 329 unique event reports. The most frequent complications were infection (39%), followed by incorrectly fitting implants (30%) and implant breaks (6%). Other major complications included cerebrospinal fluid leakage and cerebral edema (5%), wound dehiscence (5%), and migration of hardware (3%). The brands associated with the most entries in the database were the Synthes (DePuy Synthes Companies, Massachusetts, United States) polyetheretherketone (PEEK) patient-specific implants (PSI) (57%), the Biomet (Zimmer Biome, Indiana, United States) hard tissue replacement-polyetherketoneketone (HTR-PEKK) patient-matched implant (PMI) (23%), and the AccuShape PEEK PSI (MedCAD, Dallas, USA) (5%). Conclusions Infection and improperly fitting implants appear to be the two most frequent complications of cranioplasty plates. The goals of future research should include the prevention of plate infections as well as improving techniques to custom-fit implantable devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal swab testing, which has greatly increased in utilization due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is generally safe and well-tolerated, although it may be rarely associated with adverse events. METHODS: Publicly reported adverse events associated with nasopharyngeal COVID-19 testing within the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and the published literature were queried. RESULTS: A total of 129 adverse events were reported, including 66 from the MAUDE database and 63 from literature review. The most common complications were swab fracture resulting in retained foreign body (47%), followed by epistaxis (17%), and headache (11%). Seven (12%) of the reported retained foreign body cases required removal under general anesthesia, while 1 (5%) of the epistaxis cases required surgical intervention. The most serious adverse event was meningitis following cerebrospinal fluid leak. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and healthcare providers should be aware of the potential risks associated with testing, with attention to ensuring proper technique, and be prepared to recognize and manage adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The MitraClip from Abbott is FDA approved intracardiac implantable device for transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER). Despite a few previously published studies, there is limited safety data for its use in clinical practice, hence, we designed this study using data obtained from a safety nationwide database to demonstrate the safety profile of MitraClip. METHODS: The first two of the five authors independently queried all reported adverse events from the United State Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience [MAUDE] registry from January 2014 to December 2020. The primary end point was trend in reported fatal events obtained from this database. The secondary end points included the causes of reported nonfatal reports from the MAUDE registry. The trend of reported fatal events was assessed using the Cochran Armitage trend test over the period of the study. RESULTS: During the study period, subjects included 3370 patients whose MitraClip-associated adverse events were reported and captured by MAUDE registry. Of these, 211 were fatal and 3159 nonfatal events. Fatal event reports resulted deaths and reported nonfatal events were from injuries and device system malfunction. This study demonstrated an initial upward trend from 2014 to 2015 then a subsequent statistically significant downward trend in reported fatal events from 2015 to 2020 (Cochran-Armitage test P = 0.039). The peak proportion of reported fatal events occurred in 2015, (n = 44; representing 1.25% of reported adverse events) and lowest proportion of reported fatal events took place in 2020 (n = 19; representing 0.56% of reported adverse events). The most reported nonfatal events were from malfunctioning of MitraClip system (n = 1170; representing 37% of reported nonfatal events), new unremarkable repolarization abnormalities on periprocedural EKG (n = 864; representing 27% of reported nonfatal events), leaflet rupture (n = 651; representing 21% of reported nonfatal events), and cardiogenic shock (n = 170; representing 5% of reported nonfatal events). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of the MAUDE Registry indicated, especially within the confines of this study's limitations and poor data quality of information, an apparent downward trend of reported fatal events over the study period. Even though conclusive attributions cannot be made regarding this important finding, perhaps, this points to early evidence of a potential institutional or operator learning curve with this device. However, in view of the inferior quality of the data accrued from the MAUDE Registry, more high-precision studies are needed to better understand these changes, as the utility of MitraClip, becomes more established in clinical practice.",

This is the first report from a new manufacturer of a highly accurate factory calibrated CGM. The authors report that the accuracy of the AiDEX CGM is comparable to previous results from Abbott Diabetes Care and Dexcom. However, the study protocol was significantly different from previous studies. This study is the first of numerous studies likely from other manufacturers of CGM technology. It raises the question of how to evaluate sensor performance in the coming era of mass adoption of CGM and increased use of automated insulin delivery systems.",

    "Title": "Complications of Penumbra Indigo Aspiration Device in Pulmonary Embolism: Insights From MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Penumbra Indigo aspiration system (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) is a suction embolectomy device that was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). While this device has proven to be safe in clinical trials, real-world data are minimal. METHODS: The \"Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\" MAUDE database was queried for reports of Penumbra indigo system from January 2020 to August 2021. RESULTS: A total of 2118 reports were found during the study period. After the exclusion of duplicate and incomplete reports as well as reports not related to PE, our final cohort included 67 reports related to Penumbra indigo device failure. The most common failure mode was Lightning unit malfunction (35.8%, n = 24) followed by rotating hemostasis valve malfunction (31.3%, n = 21). Three (4.5%) patients died; two (3%) from fatal pulmonary vessel perforation, and one from fatal right-sided heart failure. There was one case (1.5%) of pericardial effusion, while there were no cases of hemoptysis or blood transfusion. CONCLUSION: The overall number of reports in the MAUDE registry related to the Penumbra Indigo aspiration system is small (67 reports in 20 months). The most common reported failure mode was Lightning unit malfunction. These data serve to inform operators about potential issues when using the Penumbra Indigo thrombus aspiration system and identify areas on which to focus further device iteration.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF) has been used for treating chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) refractory to medical therapy. We aim to investigate the complications associated with TIF using a national database. METHODS: We analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from Jan 2011 through Jan 2021. RESULTS: During the study period, approximately 95 event cases reported to the FDA. Approximately 131 patient complications were identified. The number of adverse events declined from 2011 to 2016 (R2 = 0.96) but increased from 2016 to 2020 (R2 = 0.99). The most common adverse event was perforation (19.8%), followed by laceration 17.6%, bleeding (9.2%), and pleural effusion (9.2%). The most common patient complications were treated using endoscopic clips (12.3%), chest tube or drain insertion (12.3%), use of endoscopic retriever device (11.1%), esophageal stent (8.6%), and emergent or open surgery (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events from TIF range from mild to severe. Further research is needed to develop approaches aimed at reducing patient risks.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The AtriCure EPi-Sense Device is used for the hybrid convergent procedure, an emerging treatment for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and long-standing persistent AF. However, data on the AE related to the EPi-Sense device are scarce. METHODS: Keyword \"EPI-SENSE\" was searched on the MAUDE database. There were 80 device reports from 2016 to 2020. After excluding reports when the device was not returned for evaluation, 79 device reports were included for final analysis. RESULTS: The adverse events (AE) were broadly classified into 11 categories. The most common complications were pericardial effusion (25.3%), stroke (17.7%), and atrioesophageal fistula (AEF) (8.9%). Death was reported in 15 (19%) cases, 3 of which were due to pulmonary embolism, 6 due to AEF, 3 due to unknown cause, 1 due to sepsis, 2 due to events related to acute renal failure. DISCUSSION: Pericardial effusion is a common AE reported in patients with convergence procedures and is well documented in the CONVERGE trial. The convergent procedure is unique in that the epicardial ablations are performed on the posterior wall with the radiofrequency probe directed towards the heart and away from the esophagus which in theory should reduce esophageal injuries. Despite that, a high number of AEF were noticed. Finally, there were also some reports of saline perfusion malfunction which can lead to injuries due to overheating. CONCLUSION: This analysis of the AE related to the EPi-Sense device highlights several major AE that are previously unreported.",

    "Title": "Renewing the Call for Reforms to Medical Device Safety-The Case of Penumbra.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Strengthening premarket and postmarket surveillance of medical devices has long been an area of focus for health policy makers. The recent class I recall (the most serious of the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] recalls) of reperfusion catheters manufactured by Penumbra, a US-based medical device company, illustrates issues of device safety and oversight that mandate attention. OBJECTIVES: To review the regulatory history and clinical evidence of the Penumbra JET 7 Reperfusion Catheter with Xtra Flex Technology (JET 7) and use the device recall as a case study of the challenges associated with clinical evaluation, transparency, and oversight of medical devices in the US. EVIDENCE: Regulatory history and clinical evidence for the Penumbra medical devices were analyzed through a qualitative review of decision letters in the Access FDA database for medical devices and medical device reports in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database and a review of market data (eg, earnings calls, company communications) and clinical literature. FINDINGS: The JET 7 device was subjected to a class I recall following more than 200 adverse event reports, 14 of which involved patient deaths. Regulatory analysis indicated that each of the Penumbra reperfusion catheters was cleared under the 510(k) pathway (which allows devices to be authorized with limited to no clinical evidence), with limited submission of either new clinical or animal data. Clinical evidence for Penumbra devices was generated from nonrandomized, single-arm trials with small sample sizes. The regulatory issues raised by JET 7 are reflective of broader challenges for medical device regulation. Opportunities for reform include strengthening premarket evidence requirements, requiring safety reporting with unique device identifiers, and mandating active methods of postmarket surveillance. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The case study of JET 7 highlights the long-standing gaps in medical device oversight and renews the impetus to build on the Institute of Medicine recommendations and reform FDA medical device regulation to protect public health.",

We queried the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 1, 2016 to December 14, 2020 for all reports of adverse events and modes of failure related to the peripheral IVL device, when used for on- and off-label indications. There were 20 reports of use in peripheral artery disease interventions and 3 reports of off-label use in coronary interventions. Device malfunction in 13 of 23 patients (56.5%) was the most common adverse event reported. Partial balloon or catheter dislodgment was the most common mode of IVL device failure in 12 of 20 patients (60%), followed by balloon rupture in 3 of 20 patients (15%). Coronary use was rare, and associated with balloon perforation in 1 of 3 patients, bradycardia in 1 of 3 patients, and aortocoronary dissection in 1 of 3 patients. In summary, IVL use carries risk of complications; hence, continued vigilance and postmarketing monitoring are warranted.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Ossicular Prostheses: Utility of a Federal Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ossicular prostheses have demonstrated utility in ossicular chain reconstruction, but their use also is associated with complications. This study aims to explore the utility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for the systematic analysis of complications associated with ossicular prostheses. It also summarizes adverse events to patients (AEPs) and device malfunctions (DMs) reported in the MAUDE database, and attempts to examine the consequences brought about by these events and to identify likely root causes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the MAUDE database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports from January 2010 to May 2020. Data were extracted from reports involving the use of ossicular prostheses. RESULTS: Seventy-three medical device reports, reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration detailing suspected device-associated malfunctions, injuries, and deaths, involved ossicular prostheses and were included for analysis, from which 126 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 50 (39.7%) were AEPs, while 76 (60.3%) were DMs. The most common AEPs were foreign body and hearing loss, while the DMs reported most commonly were broken prosthesis and displaced prosthesis. Of the 76 DMs, 19 (25%) were attributed to mishandling by the operator, while 6 (7.9%) were due to a defective device. Broken prosthesis was the DM most commonly attributed to mishandling by the operator in 16 (32.7%) cases. CONCLUSION: Ossicular prostheses are used extensively for ossicular chain reconstruction, but also are associated with adverse events. The MAUDE database in its current form does not appear sufficient for the systematic review of adverse events associated with ossicular prostheses. A more standardized reporting format with clearly defined categories and inclusion of relevant variables might improve the quality of information provided by the MAUDE database.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colonic stents are indicated for preoperative and palliative decompression of large bowel obstruction. We aim to investigate post Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval outcomes associated with colonic stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2011 to December 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 691 device issues and 742 patient complications were identified. The number of adverse events reported to the FDA mildly increased from 6.40% in 2011 to 7.4% in 2020. Most device complications were due to a positioning problem (n=201, 29%), followed by device break (n=60, 8.6%), delamination (n=41, 6.3%), and migration or expulsion device (n=38, 5.55%). A number of reports described an unclassified adverse event without specifying device or operator problem (n=141, 20.3%). The most reported patient adverse events were perforation (n=150, 20.1%), death (n=47, 6.3%), abdominal pain/discomfort (n=27, 3.6%), and peritonitis (n=24, 3.2%). CONCLUSION: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight rare but important patient and device complications which endoscopists and referring providers should be aware of before consideration for colonic stent placement.",

    "Title": "Assessing adverse event reports of hysteroscopic sterilization device removal using natural language processing.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an annotation model to apply natural language processing (NLP) to device adverse event reports and implement the model to evaluate the most frequently experienced events among women reporting a sterilization device removal. METHODS: We included adverse event reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 2005 to June 2018 related to device removal following hysteroscopic sterilization. We used an iterative process to develop an annotation model that extracts six categories of desired information and applied the annotation model to train an NLP algorithm. We assessed the model performance using positive predictive value (PPV, also known as precision), sensitivity (also known as recall), and F1 score (a combined measure of PPV and sensitivity). Using extracted variables, we summarized the reporting source, the presence of prespecified and other patient and device events, additional sterilizations and other procedures performed, and time from implantation to removal. RESULTS: The overall F1 score was 91.5% for labeled items and 93.9% for distinct events after excluding duplicates. A total of 16 535 reports of device removal were analyzed. The most frequently reported patient and device events were abdominal/pelvic/genital pain (N = 13 166, 79.6%) and device dislocation/migration (N = 3180, 19.2%), respectively. Of those reporting an additional sterilization procedure, the majority had a hysterectomy or salpingectomy (N = 7932). One-fifth of the cases that had device removal timing specified reported a removal after 7 years following implantation (N = 2444/11 293). CONCLUSIONS: We present a roadmap to develop an annotation model for NLP to analyze device adverse event reports. The extracted information is informative and complements findings from previous research using administrative data.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review postmarketing data for delayed (≥14 days post-treatment) adverse events (AEs) of interest (inflammatory and noninflammatory nodules, hypersensitivity, granulomas) for newer hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers FDA-approved within the last 5 years (2016-2020). METHODS: Reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database were extracted for HAREF, HADEF, HAKYS, HAVER, HAVLR, HAVOB, HARH2, HARH3, and HARH4 from January 2016 to January 2021. Keywords from event narratives were used to identify and categorize AEs and then verified through inclusion/exclusion criteria. Percentages are based on the total combined events of interest to provide an overall perspective of the events reported during the search period. RESULTS: Of 585 MAUDE reports, there were 195 (33.3%) delayed AEs of interest. Of those, 71.8% were nodules (42.1% inflammatory and 29.7% noninflammatory), 21.5% hypersensitivity, and 6.7% granulomas. The combined total events of interest, ordered by frequency reported, were HAVLR (74.4%), HAVOB (12.3%), HADEF (5.1%), HARH4 (3.6%), HAREF (2.6%), and HARH2 (2.1%), with no reports for HARH3, HAVER, and HAKYS. CONCLUSION: Although delayed nodules and inflammatory events are rare, reports for these events were extracted from the MAUDE database from 2016 to 2020 for HAVLR, HAVOB, HADEF, HARH4, HAREF, and HARH2 (most to least frequent).",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac perforation during leadless pacemaker implantation is more likely to require intervention than perforation by a transvenous lead. This study reports the consequences of Micra pacemaker perforations and related device and operator use problems based on information the manufacturer has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for Micra perforations. Data extracted included deaths, major adverse clinical events (MACEs), and device and/or operator use problems. RESULTS: Between 2016 and July 2021, 563 perforations were reported within 30 days of implant and resulted in 150 deaths (27%), 499 cardiac tamponades (89%), 64 pericardial effusions (11%), and 146 patients (26%) required emergency surgery. Half of perforations were associated with 139 (25%) device problems, 78 (14%) operator use problems, and 62 (11%) combined device and operator use problems. Inadequate electrical measurements or difficult positioning were the most frequent device problems (n = 129); non-septal implants and perforation of other structures were the most frequent operator use problems (n = 69); a combined operator use and device problem resulted in 62 delivery system perforations. No device or operator use problem was identified for 282 perforations (50%), but they were associated with 78 deaths, 245 tamponades, and 57 emergency surgeries. CONCLUSION: The Micra perforations reported in MAUDE are often associated with death and major complications requiring emergency intervention. Device and use problems account for at least half of perforations. Studies are needed to identify who is at risk for a perforation and how MACE can be avoided or mitigated.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with Dermabond® during head and neck surgery: MAUDE and literature review.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dermabond® is a liquid surgical sealant containing 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate that has been widely used during head and neck surgeries. This study aims to provide a summary of adverse events related to Dermabond® in head and neck procedures as reported in the MAUDE database, and to report a complete overview of all documented adverse events related to Dermabond® use in current literature. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports of adverse events related to Dermabond® use from January 1, 2010, to February 1, 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to head and neck procedures. In addition, literature review was performed from January 1970 to January 2021. Various adverse events related to Dermabond® were included in the study. RESULTS: We identified 32 adverse events, from which 29 (90.6%) were patient-related events and 3 (9.4%) were operator-related events. Of the patient-related events, contact dermatitis (CD) (20 [69.0%]) was the most common, followed by wound dehiscence (4 [13.8%]). All of the operator-related events were from inadvertent cut injury (3 [100%]). Following the literature review, adverse events of Dermabond® were categorized into CD, wound dehiscence, infection, and cut injury. CONCLUSION: Dermabond® demonstrated utility in various surgical procedures including head and neck surgeries but are associated with risks. This study identified adverse events associated with Dermabond®. Further studies are needed to establish the causation of contact dermatitis in certain populations.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Esophageal function testing is an integral component of the evaluation of refractory GERD and esophageal motility disorders. This review summarizes the current technologies available for esophageal function testing, including the functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP), high-resolution esophageal manometry (HRM), and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE, PubMed, and MAUDE database literature search to identify pertinent clinical studies through March 2021 using the following key words: esophageal manometry, HRM, esophageal impedance, FLIP, MII, and esophageal pH testing. Technical data were gathered from traditional and web-based publications, proprietary publications, and informal communications with pertinent vendors. The report was drafted, reviewed, and edited by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Technology Committee and approved by the Governing Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. RESULTS: FLIP is a high-resolution impedance planimetry system used for pressure and dimension measurement in the esophagus, pylorus, and anal sphincter. FLIP provides complementary information to HRM for esophageal motility disorders, especially achalasia. The Chicago classification, based on HRM data, is a widely adopted algorithmic scheme used to diagnose esophageal motility disorders. MII detects intraluminal bolus movement and, combined with pH measurement or manometry, provides information on acid and non-acid gastroesophageal reflux and bolus transit in patients with refractory GERD and for preoperative evaluation for anti-reflux procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal function testing techniques (FLIP, HRM, and MII-pH) have diagnostic and prognostic value in the evaluation of esophageal motility disorders and refractory GERD. Newer technologies and classification systems have enabled an increased understanding of these diseases.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The AXIOS stent is indicated for transgastric or transduodenal drainage of symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts and symptomatic walled off necrosis. The AXIOS stent functions as a conduit which allows solid and liquid pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) contents to pass into the luminal GI tract and also allows the passage of standard and therapeutic endoscopes into the PFC to perform endoscopic debridement. We aim to investigate the number and type of complications associated with AXIOS stents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database January 2016 to February 2021. RESULTS: During the study period, approximately 588 reports with 579 device issues and 250 patient complications were identified. Most device complications were due to stent positioning problems or stent malpositioning (n = 206; 35.6%), followed by stent migration (n = 72; 12.4%), premature deployment (n = 61; 10.5%), material integrity (n = 56; 9.6%), deployment failure (n = 47; 8.1%), and difficulty removing the stent (n = 45; 7.7%). The most reported patient adverse events were hemorrhage/bleeding (n = 81; 32.4%), perforation (n = 26; 10.4%), pain (n = 22; 8.8%), unspecified infection (n = 20; 8.0%), and death (n = 17; 6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight patient and device complications which endoscopists should be aware of before AXIOS stent placement.",

    "Title": "Characterizing Complications of Intracranial Responsive Neurostimulation Devices for Epilepsy Through a Retrospective Analysis of the Federal MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Responsive neurostimulation is an innovative modality in the treatment of medication-refractory epilepsy for patients who are not suitable candidates for surgical intervention. While being a potentially life-changing treatment option for many individuals with epilepsy, little is known about the system's complications aside from its performance in initial clinical trials. Therefore, the goal of this study was to characterize all reported complications of the RNS system made to the Food & Drug Administration since its approval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for entries reported under \"implanted brain stimulator for epilepsy\" through the dates of November 1, 2013, to March 1, 2020. After correction of duplicate entries, each was sorted into complication types based on the entries' narrative descriptions. RESULTS: The searched yielded 241 unique complication events. The most common complications were attributed to infections (40%) and lead breaks (12%). Other reported complications included poor wound healing (10%) and intrinsic device failure (7%). Focal neurological deficits were found in 2%. Over half (67%) of the reported complications required return to the operating room for revision or explant. The remainder of the adverse events were self-resolved or treated with either medication or software adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Future research endeavors should attempt to optimize the implantable device for preventing infections. The data of complications provided by this review will also aid physicians in providing the most accurate informed consent for patients when deciding to undergo implantation with the responsive neurostimulation system.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-frequency (10-kHz) spinal cord stimulation (SCS) continues to be an emerging therapy in chronic pain management. The same complications that plagued earlier SCS systems may affect newer stimulation technologies, although there is limited data on the type of complications and surgical management of these complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically examine real-world complications associated with 10-kHz SCS reported on the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for entries reported between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. Entries were classified into procedural complications, device-related complications, patient complaints, surgically managed complications, serious adverse events, and/or other complications. Primary outcomes included type and frequency of complications, and surgical management of complications. RESULTS: A total of 1651 entries were analyzed. Most entries were categorized as procedural complications (72.6%), followed by serious adverse events (10.5%), device-related complications (10.5%), and patient complaints (9.9%). Most complications were managed surgically with explant (50.9%) rather than revision (5.0%) or incision/drainage (6.6%). Of procedural complications, the most common entries included non-neuraxial infection (52.9%), new neurological symptoms (14.7%), and dural puncture (9.5%). Of device-related complications, the most common entries included lead damage (41.6%), erosion (18.5%), and difficult insertion (11.5%). CONCLUSION: This retrospective 5-year analysis of complications from10-kHz SCS provides a real-world assessment of safety data unique for this stimulation modality. This analysis may help inform future clinical decisions, lead to device enhancement and optimization, and improve mitigation of risks to provide safe and efficacious use of 10-kHz SCS.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Partial ossicular replacement (PORP) and total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP) are used to restore ossicular chain function. Despite favorable auditory outcomes, these interventions have associated risks and complications. This study examines the FDA MAUDE database for ossicular chain prosthesis adverse events to highlight complications, interventions, and root cause analysis (RCA) findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for Medical Device Reports (MDRs) relating to PORPs and TORPs from 2010 to 2020. MDR event descriptions were reviewed, and adverse events were identified as a device issue, patient issue, and/or packaging issue that occurred intraoperatively or postoperatively. RESULTS: Our search identified 70 MDRs which included 110 reported adverse events. Events consisted of 63 device issues, often due to device breaks and displacements, 39 patient issues, including common complaints of hearing loss and erosion, and 8 packaging issues. When comparing PORPs and TORPs, TORPs had more reported device issues whereas PORPs had more packaging issues. Intraoperative device issues were commonly resolved by completing the procedure with a backup device and most postoperative device issues required additional surgery. For devices returned to the manufacturer, RCA determined that most breaks were caused by modification and/or mishandling or that the product met specifications with an undetermined cause for the break. CONCLUSION: Device issues were the most common adverse events and frequently required subsequent intervention. Displacement occurred more often with TORPs and was associated with changes in hearing or erosion. The findings of this study are purely descriptive and may not have direct clinical relevance.",

    "Title": "Analysis of reported adverse events related to single-use duodenoscopes and duodenoscopes with detachable endcaps.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Single-use duodenoscopes and duodenoscopes with detachable/disposable caps emerged in the market to mitigate the risk of ERCP-related infections. We aimed to investigate adverse events associated with these devices occurring after U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. METHODS: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from July 2018 to June 2021. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five reports comprising 201 device issues and 118 patient adverse events were identified from July 2018 through June 2021. Most device issues related to the single-use duodenoscope were due to optical problems (7 reports). Other reported device issues included difficulty in advancing the duodenoscope (2 reports), fluid leak (2 reports), and use-of-device problems (2 reports). Among the duodenoscopes with detachable/disposable caps, most device issues were related to bacterial contamination (53 reports), followed by issues with device use (31 reports), detachment/separation of the device (25 reports), and crack/dent in device material (16 reports). Overall, the most frequently reported patient adverse events were tissue injury (63 reports), perforation (8 reports), and bleeding (7 reports). Ninety reports of microbial contamination of duodenoscopes with detachable/disposable caps were identified, of which Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most common. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight patient and device adverse events that endoscopists should be aware of in using single-use duodenoscopes and duodenoscopes with detachable/disposable caps. Whereas these devices mitigate the risk of transmitting infection, they are associated with additional device-associated adverse events.",

    "Title": "Breaking it down: Review and management of sialendoscopy device malfunctions.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The present study was aimed at determining common causes of sialendoscopy device malfunctions and identifying a uniform algorithm to manage device failures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for various keywords related to sialendoscopy. Reports between the dates of December 1, 2009 to March 31, 2020 were downloaded for review and included in the study. Variables such as: device, the iatrogenic injury type, and subsequent surgical or medical intervention were collected and details of the malfunction were categorized based on the type of malfunction. RESULTS: 206 medical device reports were identified; 47 of them which met inclusion criteria (106 were duplicate cases and 53 were irrelevant to the present study). The majority of device malfunctions involved salivary stone extractor baskets (SSEBs), (40/47; 85.1%), followed by malfunctions of balloon dilators (3/47; 6.4%) and sialendoscopes (2/47; 4.3%). Retention of the SSEB was noted in 85% of the SSEB malfunctions. CONCLUSIONS: Given that sialendoscopy is an increasingly popular technique that relies on devices, it is inevitable that device failures will occur for a multitude of reasons. Working to prevent these malfunctions from occurring is the most effective method of harm reduction. Though it is important that sialendoscopists have a discrete, algorithmic approach to manage them when they occur.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Complications in Sacroiliac Joint Fusions Using FDA 510(k) Cleared Devices.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: This was a level III-retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to present an unbiased report of the current rate of severe complications for Federal Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) cleared sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusions and investigate the underlying cause of these complications. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The number of yearly SIJ fusions is on an upward trend. Currently, the most utilized implants to fuse the SIJ have been FDA 510(k) cleared devices. Studies reporting on complications following SIJ fusions are mostly industry-sponsored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for all reported FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion device complications. Several data points were obtained from each report and recorded. The Hospital Inpatient National Statistics and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was also searched for the number of SIJ fusions performed each year. RESULTS: A search of the MAUDE database returned 1115 reports, with the first report on June 30, 2011, and the last report on July 28, 2020. Patient injury was the most common type of event reported at 97.5% (1080/1107). Death was reported in 3 patients (0.3%). Malposition was the most common device problem at 49.5% (548/1107). The root cause of these events was primarily user error at 58.2% (644/1107). Revision surgery or reoperation occurred in 92.8% (1028/1107) of reports. Data for SIJ fusions through CMS showed an overall trend of increasing yearly SIJ fusions. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of complications reported to MAUDE for FDA 510(k) cleared SIJ fusion devices are user error due to improper placement of implants. These complications are likely underreported, and there is currently no formal tracking system of total SIJ fusions performed to calculate accurate complication and revision rates. Patient injury and health care costs can potentially be reduced with improved education, training, and oversight, which is currently lacking.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this technologic analysis was to analyze technologic features of abdominal negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). APPROACH: Published literature regarding abdominal negative pressure wound therapy (aNPWT) devices was reviewed. A summary of management approaches for the open abdomen provides a foundation for understanding the benefits of aNPWT. Safety information regarding aNPWT was derived from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. CONCLUSIONS: The open abdomen approach with temporary abdominal closure may be employed for patients with a variety of conditions. Specialized abdominal NPWT devices, either singly or in combination with other approaches, may contribute to improved outcomes in this high-risk patient population. Manufacturer recommendations and clinical guidelines should be followed to minimize patient risk.",

    "Title": "Stapler Malfunctions in Bariatric Surgery: An Analysis of the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Staple line leaks are a serious problem in bariatric surgery and a major cause of serious morbidity and mortality. Adverse events caused by medical devices are reported to the Food and Drug Administration which maintains the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We examined adverse stapler events reported to the MAUDE database, specifically with regards to bariatric surgery. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for adverse events caused by staplers between January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020; events reported by Intuitive, Ethicon, and Medtronic/Covidien; and limited our search to \"gastric bypass\", \"sleeve gastrectomy\", \"stapler malfunction\" combined with each company. RESULTS: There were 883 adverse events reported for Medtronic, 353 for Ethicon, and 35 for Intuitive. Approximately 3.5 million staple reloads sold in the study period. The reported misfire rate for Medtronic was 0.04% and for Ethicon was 0.02%. Data for Intuitive was unavailable. The most common reported event for Medtronic was failure to fire (n = 349), followed by misfire (n = 186). For Ethicon, the most common event was failure to fire (n = 146), followed by mechanical problems (n = 27). The most common event with the Intuitive stapler was leak (n = 10) and bleeding from staple line (n = 8). CONCLUSIONS: Stapler malfunction is a very rare event in metabolic and bariatric surgery. All of the major stapler producers have transitioned to powered staplers with excellent safety profiles. Open and honest reporting about stapler malfunction is essential to determine the true safety of these ubiquitous devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of robotic assistance in arthroplasty is increasing; however, the spectrum of adverse events potentially associated with this technology is unclear. Improved understanding of the causes of adverse events in robotic-assisted arthroplasty can prevent future incidents and enhance patient outcomes. METHODS: Adverse event reports to the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database involving robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and partial knee arthroplasty were reviewed to determine causes of malfunction and related patient impact. RESULTS: Overall, 263 adverse event reports were included. The most frequently reported adverse events were unexpected robotic arm movement for TKA (59/204, 28.9%) and retained registration checkpoint for THA (19/44, 43.2%). There were 99 reports of surgical delay with an average delay of 20 minutes (range 1-120). Thirty-one cases reported conversion to manual surgery. In total, 68 patient injuries were reported, 7 of which required surgical reintervention. Femoral notching (12/36, 33.3%) was the most common for TKA and retained registration checkpoint (19/28, 67.9%) was the most common for THA. Although rare, additional reported injuries included femoral, tibial, and acetabular fractures, MCL laceration, additional retained foreign bodies, and an electrical burn. CONCLUSION: Despite the increasing utilization of robotic-assisted arthroplasty in the United States, numerous adverse events are possible and technical difficulties experienced intraoperatively can result in prolonged surgical delays. The events reported herein seem to indicate that robotic-assisted arthroplasty is generally safe with only a few reported instances of serious complications, the nature of which seems more related to suboptimal surgical technique than technology. Based on our data, the practice of adding registration checkpoints and bone pins to the instrument count of all robotic-assisted TJA cases should be widely implemented to avoid unintended retained foreign objects.",

    "Title": "Cancer Risk Associated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure: A National Study.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In 2021 the U.S. FDA issued a Class 1 safety recall notice for specific devices due to a risk of carcinogen exposure. The objective of this study was to evaluate reports of cancer linked to CPAP devices to understand implications for the field of sleep medicine. METHODS: Cases of cancer involving CPAP devices were retrieved from the MAUDE database from 2014 to 2021 and analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 2571 patient injuries were associated with CPAP. Reports of cancer (n = 209; 4.62%) were the second most commonly documented patient problem associated with CPAP, although 1950 (43.13%) patients had a device problem without an associated injury. Of the 209 cancer cases associated with CPAP, 200 (95.7%) of the adverse event reports were received by the FDA in 2021. There were 174 (9.15%) descriptions of the CPAP polyurethane sound abatement foam degrading in association with a cancer diagnosis, but degradation was more commonly not associated with malignancy (n = 1728; 90.85%). Other frequently documented CPAP device problems included broken devices (n = 279; 6.92%), fire (n = 182; 4.51%), and patient-device incompatibility (n = 144; 3.57%). CONCLUSION: Malignancy associated with CPAP devices has been reported; however, future studies are required to establish causation. Given 95.7% of those documented cases were reported in 2021, otolaryngologists should be prepared to discuss the risks of carcinogenesis associated with CPAP. The otolaryngology community should also be aware of the potential bandwagon effect and the implications for CPAP compliance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 132:2270-2274, 2022.",

    "Title": "Device-related complications during renal cryoablation: insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cryoablation offers a treatment option for small renal masses ideally suited ≤3 cm. In well-selected candidates, it is associated with less perioperative morbidity compared to more invasive options, such as partial or radical nephrectomy. However, little is known regarding device-related complications associated with the procedure. We provide an analysis of reports on renal cryoablation from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Reports on renal cryoablation submitted to the MAUDE database from 2015 through 6/2021 were analyzed. Cases not pertaining to renal cryoablation were excluded (n = 33). Reports were examined to identify patient morbidity related to a potential device malfunction, as well as manufacturer assessment. Complications were graded based on an established MAUDE complication-reporting stratification. Fisher's Exact test was utilized to analyze for associations between device-related adverse events and severity of post-treatment sequelae. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-nine unique cases were identified. Adverse events were related to issues with the needles or system (212 cases), technical error (12 cases), or complication related to patient or tumor complexity (14 cases). There were 187 (78.6%) minor complications (MAUDE 1-2) and 52 (21.4%) major complications (MAUDE 3-4). The manufacturer performed formal device review in 164 (68.6%) cases, accepting responsibility for malfunction in 41. Notable MAUDE 3 complications included 29 (12.1%) cases aborted due to instrument/system malfunction and 14 (5.9%) cases of hemorrhage requiring a subsequent procedure. All 3 reported patient deaths (MAUDE 4) appeared to be a consequence of poor baseline health. On statistical analysis, major complications were seen in a significantly higher proportion of non-device related adverse events compared to device related events (85.2% vs. 13.7%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: While renal cryoablation is associated with low overall perioperative morbidity, there is a diverse set of device-related and procedural complications reported in recent years. Device-related adverse events were often associated with minor complications, and major complications were often seen in higher risk patients with comorbidities, more complex tumors, and after technical error. These findings highlight the need for standardized reporting of complications, optimized patient selection and counseling to ensure the best outcomes.",

    "Title": "Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Reporting of Events Related to Transvaginal Mesh: Understanding the Data.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine potential bias in reports to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database involving vaginal mesh by identifying the party submitting the report, the nature of the complaints, and whether the reports were edited. METHODS: All reports submitted to the MAUDE database involving synthetic transvaginal mesh from January 2000 through December 2017 (40,266 safety reports) were identified. A random 2% sample (900) of these reports was reviewed in depth to determine the specific relevant details, including reporter type (patient, manufacturer, lawyer) and details of the complaint/injury. RESULTS: Of the 40,226 reports to MAUDE identified, 28,473 (70.7%) were sling reports, and 11,793 (29.3%) described mesh products augmenting pelvic organ prolapse repair. Of the 900 reports reviewed in depth, 46%, 41%, 10%, and 2% of entries were reported by the manufacturer, attorney, health care provider, and patients, respectively. In the 4 years after submission, 18.6% of reports were modified at least once. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database allows physicians, manufacturers, and patients to immediately report adverse events experienced due to medical devices. While this database is an important means to identify potential danger to patients, any individual can file a report and, thus, it should not be the sole source of evidence to consider when assessing device safety. Further, the MAUDE database provides no information into the total number of cases performed without complication.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a widely used technique for the removal of precancerous or select cancerous mucosal-based lesions. Two systems used for EMR of upper gastrointestinal lesions are the Duette EMR kit and the Captivator EMR kit. The aim of this study is to analyze the reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for patient-related adverse events and device failures associated with these EMR kits. METHODS: We analyzed postmarketing data from the FDA MAUDE from August 2004 to August 2021. RESULTS: Eighty-four MAUDE reports were found in the study period from August 2004 to August 2021. In total, device issues comprised 36.9% of the reports (n=31) and patient adverse events comprised 63.09% of the reports (n=53). Device issues that were reported included, but were not limited to, band placement/deployment failure (8.1%), suture breakage (7.31%), and snare breakage (4.94%). Patient adverse events that were reported included, but were not limited to, bleeding (25.9%), perforation (7.31%), and snare breakage (4.94%). CONCLUSION: Captivator EMR and Duette EMR have similar patterns of technical failure and clinical adverse events. More MAUDE reports exist for Duette EMR, possibly due to its longer duration of commercial availability.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this Technologic Analysis is to review devices designed to measure intra-abdominal pressure (IAP); these devices are used to detect intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). APPROACH: Published literature focusing on devices designed to measure IAP was reviewed, comparing the options available and outlining recommendations for appropriate use. Safety information regarding IAP measurement devices was derived from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal hypertension is prevalent among critically ill patients of all ages and is linked to adverse consequences, such as abdominal compartment syndrome. The condition is often unrecognized due to the lack of overt clinical symptoms, supporting the need for devices to accurately measure IAP. Commercially available devices measure IAP indirectly, typically via the bladder or stomach. Additional research is needed to demonstrate the benefits of routine screening, further define risk factors for IAH/ACS development, and evaluate the impact of measures to reduce IAP in an effort to improve patient outcomes.",

    "Title": "Complications Reported to the Food and Drug Administration: A Cross-sectional Comparison of Urogynecologic Meshes.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to evaluate the safety of urogynecologic meshes; however, reports on individual meshes have not been characterized. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare complications among available urogynecologic meshes reported to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of medical device reports (MDRs) of urogynecologic mesh from January 2004 to March 2019, using the Reed Tech Navigator (LexisNexis), which codes MDRs. The percentage of reports containing specific complaints (not an adverse event rate) were compared with χ 2 tests with Dunn-Sidak correction. Correlations with time on market, mesh weight, stiffness, and porosity were determined. RESULTS: The 34,485 reports examined included 6 transvaginal meshes, 4 sacrocolpopexy meshes, and 10 midurethral slings. Most reported events were pain, erosion, and infection. For transvaginal prolapse, less than 10% of Uphold Lite (Boston Scientific) reports contained pain or erosion versus greater than 90% of Prolift/Prolift+M (Ethicon, P < 0.001). For sacrocolpopexy mesh, greater than 90% of Gynemesh (Ethicon; Prolift in vaginal form) reports included erosion and pain versus less than 60% for Artisyn (Ethicon), Restorelle (Colpoplast), and Upsylon (Boston Scientific, P < 0.0001). For slings, Gynecare TVT Obturator had the highest proportion of erosion and pain complaints. Heavier sling meshes had more reports. When Ascend (Caldera Medical), an outlier with only 5 reports, was excluded, transvaginal mesh stiffness correlated strongly with number of reports. For transvaginal meshes, number of reports correlated with time on market (ρ = 0.8, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Individual meshes have different properties with different complication profiles, which should inform mesh development and use.

    "Title": "Adverse events of subcutaneous loop recorders: Insights from the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complications using internal cardiac monitors (ICM) have been reported at a low rate. Targeted analyses of complications have not been well described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and describe complications associated with ICM events reported to the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Our team reviewed all reported events for the Reveal LINQ loop recorder submitted to the MAUDE database over 7 years (1/1/2013-12/31/2019). A 5% random selection of reports was audited by two researchers to ensure report validity. Two cardiologists manually reviewed death and incongruent events for final interpretation. RESULTS: 12,652 records were obtained during the observed time period. A total of 15,587 device complications were reported. Of this, undersensing (n = 4509, 28.93%), premature discharge of battery (n = 3262, 20.93%), oversensing (n = 2788, 17.89%), and other sensing issues (n = 1532, 9.83%) were most commonly reported. Patient adverse events were reported 1,030 times. Pain or discomfort (n = 275, 26.70%), site infection (n = 213, 20.68%), erosion (n = 138, 13.40%), and impaired healing (n = 49, 4.76%) were most commonly reported to affect patients. Death was reported four times; after expert review, no reports justified the device or procedure as a reasonable cause. CONCLUSION: Several non-life-threatening ICM complications were commonly noted from the analysis. This study supports the safe use of ICMs. A better understanding of the complication profile will help providers select patients, provide informed consent, and expected management.",

    "Title": "Complications of Endobronchial Valve Placement for Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction: Insights From the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE).",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced emphysema experience breathlessness due to impaired respiratory mechanics and diaphragm dysfunction. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) is a minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedure done to reduce hyperinflation and air trapping, promoting atelectasis in the targeted lobe and allowing improved respiratory mechanics. Real-world data on safety and complications outside of clinical trials of BLVR are limited. METHODS: We queried the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Manufacturers and User Device Experience database from May 2019 to June 2020 for reports involving BLVR with endobronchial valve (EBV) placement. Events were reviewed for data analysis. RESULTS: We identified 124 cases of complications during BLVR with EBV implantation. The most-reported complication was pneumothorax (110/124, 89%), all of which required chest tube placement. A total of 54 of these cases (54/110, 49%) were complicated by persistent air leak requiring additional interventions. Repeat bronchoscopy was needed to remove the valves in 28 patients, 12 were discharged with a Heimlich valve, and 10 had an additional pleural catheter placed. The other complications of BLVR with EBV placement included respiratory failure (6/124, 5%), pneumonia (4/124, 3%), hemoptysis (2/124, 1.6%), valve migration (1/124, 1%), and pleural effusion (1/124, 1%). A total of 14 deaths were reported during that year. CONCLUSION: Pneumothorax is the most-reported complication for BLVR with EBV placement, and in 65% of cases, pneumothorax is managed without removing valves. Importantly, 14 deaths were reported during that timeframe. Further studies are needed to estimate the true magnitude of the complications associated with BLVR.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanical lithotripsy is a commonly used, effective method for fragmenting large biliary or pancreatic duct stones. Real-world data on the most commonly reported adverse events and modes of failure associated with mechanical lithotripters are limited. We analyzed the postmarketing surveillance data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for 3 commercially available mechanical lithotripters for use during ERCP. METHODS: A search of the MAUDE database from January 2010 to October 2021 was conducted for the following mechanical lithotripters: Trapezoid RX (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass, USA), LithoCrush (Olympus Endoscopy, Center Valley, Pa, USA), and the Fusion Lithotripsy Extraction Basket (Cook Endoscopy, Winston Salem, NC, USA). Results were compiled and reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 1128 medical device reports with 2129 device malfunctions and 205 patient adverse events were identified. Most device malfunctions were because of guidewire port or sheath failure (n = 379, 17.8%), basket entrapment (n = 357, 16.8%), and basket tip separation failure (n = 315, 14.8%). The most commonly reported adverse events to patients were an additional procedure to remove an entrapped basket (170/205, 82.9%), bleeding (15/205, 7.3%), and bowel perforation (5/205, 2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight device- and patient-related adverse outcomes that should be recognized to improve clinical success and reduce patient risk.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Image-Guided Sinus Navigation in Endoscopic Sinus Surgery: A MAUDE Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The utilization of image-guided navigation during endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) has increased significantly since its introduction. However, the most common associated complications are still unknown. This study describes and analyzes adverse events related to image-guided ESS. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The Food and Drug Administration's 2018-2022 MAUDE database (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for all reports on adverse events involving sinus navigation systems used in ESS from 2018 to 2022. Reported events were reviewed and categorized. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 1857 adverse events from 1565 reports, which were divided into device-related (n = 1834, 98.8%) and patient-related (n = 23, 1.2%) complications. The most common device-related complications were nonfunctionality of the system (n = 512, 27.9%), device imprecision (n = 427, 23.3%), and device sensing problems (n = 277, 15.1%). The most common patient-related complications were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak (n = 14, 60.9%), intracranial injury (n = 4, 17.4%), and bleeding/hemorrhage (n = 3, 13.1%). Imprecision was associated with increased risk of navigation abortion by the surgeon (odds ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38-1.65]; P < .001) and increased risk of CSF leak (odds ratio, 16.5 [95% CI, 3.66-74.0]; P < .001) as compared with other device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly reported device- and patient-related adverse events associated with image-guided sinus navigation systems were device nonfunction, imprecision, device sensing difficulties, and CSF leak. When imprecise navigation occurred, there was an increased likelihood of CSF leak and navigation abortion by the surgeon. Health care providers should be mindful of these possible complications when electing to use image-guided sinus navigation during ESS.",

    "Title": "Turnpike Catheter failure, causes and mechanisms: Insights from the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Turnpike catheters (Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) is a microcatheter that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in November 2014 to be used to access discrete regions of the coronary and peripheral vasculature. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports of the Turnpike catheters from March 2015 through August 2021. RESULTS: A total of 216 reports were found during the study period. After excluding duplicate reports (n = 21), our final cohort included 195 reports. The most common failure mode was catheter tip break or detachment (83%, n = 165) which was significantly associated with over-torquing (p-value = 0.025). The most common clinical consequence was the entrapment of the catheter (33%, n = 65), followed by vessel injury (7.8% n = 15) and vessel occlusion (3.6%, n = 7). Most patients had no consequences (47.0%, n = 93) or recovered (11%, n = 22). A total of 4 deaths were reported. 35.8% of reports (n = 69) specified the presence of severe calcification in the target vessel. Over torquing by interventionists was reported in 33.2% of events (n = 64). CONCLUSION: Despite clinical trials demonstrating the safety of the Turnpike catheters, complications can still occur. These data serve to inform operators about potentional risks and complications associated with the use of the device. Physicians should avoid over-torqueing which seems to be the most common mechanism for device complications.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: While adverse events (AEs) are all too prevalent, their underlying causes are difficult to assess because they are often multifactorial. Standardizing the language of dental AEs is an important first step toward increasing patient safety for the dental patient. METHODS: We followed a multimodal approach building a dental AE inventory, which included a literature review; review of the MAUDE database; a cross-sectional, self-administered patient survey; focus groups; interviews with providers and domain experts; and chart reviews. RESULTS: One hundred eight unique allergy/toxicity/foreign body response, 70 aspiration/ingestion of foreign body, 70 infection, 52 wrong site/wrong patient/wrong procedure, 23 bleeding, 48 pain, 149 hard tissue injury, 127 soft tissue injury, 91 nerve injury, 171 other systemic complication, and 177 other orofacial complication were identified. Subtype AEs within the categories revealed that allergic reaction, aspiration, pain, and wrong procedure were the most common AEs identified among known (i.e., chart reviews) and hypothetical (i.e., interviews) sources. CONCLUSIONS: Using a multimodal approach, a broad list of dental AEs was developed, in which the AEs were classed into 12 categories. Hard tissue injury was noted frequently during interviews and in actuality. Pain was the unexpected AE that was consistently identified with every modality used. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Most AEs result in temporary harm with hard tissue injury being a common AE identified through interviews and in actuality through chart reviews. Acknowledging that AEs happen is an important step toward mitigating them and assuring quality of care for our patients.",

    "Title": "Complications With Noninvasive Fat and Cellulite Reduction Devices: A Cross-sectional Analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The US FDA mandates that manufacturers and device operators disclose medical device reports (MDRs) to monitor suspected injuries and device malfunctions by submitting information to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Given the rapid growth in the noninvasive fat and cellulite reduction market, it is essential that physicians be aware of associated adverse events. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the MAUDE electronic database on the FDA website, the authors performed a comprehensive search of reported complications of noninvasive fat reduction and cellulite reduction devices from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2020 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm. Medical device reports that likely represented medical adverse events from device use were included. RESULTS: The search yielded 165 MDRs, a majority submitted by patients. There were 68 MDRs reported on cryolipolysis (41.2%), 34 MDRs reported on 1,060-nm laser lipolysis (20.6%), 19 MDRs reported on high-intensity focused ultrasound (11.5%), 17 MDRs reported on vacuum-assisted subcision (10.3%), 10 MDRs reported on 1,440-nm laser-assisted subcision (6.1%), 8 MDRs reported on monopolar radiofrequency (4.8%), 6 MDRs reported on focused ultrasound (3.6%), and 4 MDRs reported for a combination infrared light, bipolar radiofrequency energy, massage, and gentle suction treatment (2.4%). CONCLUSION: It can be safely presumed that most physicians do not regularly report adverse events to the FDA; however, the MAUDE database remains the largest global repository of adverse events reported for noninvasive body contouring devices, an area that has grown tremendously over the last few years. Some MDRs may be unrelated and/or unsubstantiated, and MDRs for any given device must be correlated to the total number of procedures performed. Nevertheless, the MAUDE database allows a glimpse into potential adverse events that can occur. The authors hope that physician awareness of this database and the adverse events it reports will help improve patient safety.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Barrx™ radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter system comes in several different variations and sizes and is widely used for the eradication of Barrett's esophagus (BE). The Barrx™ 360 and 360 Express system is used to perform circumferential RFA, while the Barrx™ focal catheter system is used for secondary focal RFA or primary treatment of short-segment BE. We aimed to investigate the number and type of complications and device failures associated with the Barrx™ RFA catheter system. METHOD: We analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from August 2011 to August 2021. RESULTS: During the study period, 148 unique reports detailing 78 device issues and 87 patient-related adverse events were identified. The most reported adverse events for patients were stenosis secondary to treatment (n=15, 17.24%), mucosal laceration of the esophagus (n=13, 14.94%), chest pain (n=10, 11.49%), and odynophagia/dysphagia (n=7, 8.05%). The most common device complication was failure of the device to deploy when activated (n=10, 13.82%). Other device malfunctions included material deformation/distortion (n=7, 8.97%), catheter breakage (n=6, 7.69%), connection problems between the generator cable and RFA device (n=6, 7.69%), and failure of the balloon to properly inflate (n=5, 6.41%). CONCLUSION: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight patient and device complications that endoscopists should be aware of prior to RFA of BE with the Barrx™ RFA catheter system.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this technologic analysis was to review use of ionic silver as a component of topical wound therapy products. APPROACH: Published literature from a variety of fields related to ionic silver and its use in topical wound therapy products was reviewed and a summary of common commercially available wound care products containing ionic silver was generated, along with general recommendations for use. Safety information from both manufacturer guidelines and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Various formulations of ionic silver products are used for topical treatment of wounds. Antimicrobial activity varies according to the specific silver formulation and type of microorganisms in the wound bed. In vitro evidence suggests that some bacterial strains may be developing resistance to ionic silver. Improved knowledge of the benefits and safety precautions associated with topical silver preparations can guide its application to topical therapy for wound healing.",

    "Title": "Image-Guided Surgical Device Failures in Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery: A MAUDE Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Image-guided surgery (IGS) devices have become widely used for anatomic localization during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). However, there are no studies that analyze the post-market complications associated with IGS device use during FESS. The objective of this study was to better characterize post-market complications associated with the use of IGS devices during sinus surgery. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for event reports associated with neurological stereotaxic devices utilized in IGS between the dates of January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. Medical device reports that were analyzed for this study pertained strictly to FESS. RESULTS: There were 1873 reports involving IGS devices for FESS included in this study. Fifty-five reports involved adverse events to patients (2.9%) and 1818 (97.1%) involved device malfunctions. Of the adverse events to patients, the most common included cerebrospinal fluid leakage (45.6%), tissue damage (12.7%), and nervous system injury (3.6%). The most commonly reported device malfunction was imprecision (21.1%). CONCLUSION: IGS devices are widely utilized in FESS. Of the medical device reports between 2016 and 2020, less than 3% resulted in adverse events. Further studies of the infrequent post-market complications of IGS devices used in FESS can help guide surgeons on the risks of their clinical use.

    "Title": "FDA MAUDE database reported adverse events on noninvasive body contouring, cellulite treatment, and muscle stimulation from 2015 to 2021.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive cosmetic procedures have continued to gain popularity, owing to their short, in-office treatments combined with little to no downtime. These procedures are also highly accessible, even offered at medical spas by nonphysician operators. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic also saw heightened interest in all cosmetic procedures, presumably as social distancing and stay-at-home orders allotted time and space for postop recovery. As the market for these procedures expand, a thorough understanding of potential adverse events is critical for providers to better counsel their patients on risks and expectations when obtaining informed consent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm), which compiles medical device reports (MDRs) for suspected injuries from device use or malfunction, submitted by manufactures and operators. We focused our query on three main categories: noninvasive body contouring, cellulite treatments, and muscle stimulation therapies that utilize electromagnetic energy. The query was performed in February 2022 using a comprehensive list of product names and manufacturers. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 827 MDRs, which were individually reviewed for duplicate reports or insufficient data. Ultimately, 723 MDRs were analyzed (660 for noninvasive body contouring, 55 for cellulite treatment, and 8 for muscle stimulation). Paradoxical hyperplasia accounted for the majority of MDRs for noninvasive body contouring, while burns and scars were most common for muscle stimulation and cellulite treatments, respectively. Of the 7-year span we surveyed, 2021 accounted for 515 of the 723 total assessed MDRs (71.2%), the majority of which were from cryolipolysis procedures. CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database remains an essential tool to monitor potential adverse events of medical devices, including those utilized for noninvasive, cosmetic procedures. Insight from the MAUDE database can be clinically translated when discussing treatment options with patients, helping to optimize patient safety and satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "The pulse-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) PlasmaBlade 3.0 and 4.0 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is an electrosurgical technology that is widely used in surgery. Our study aimed to summarize device malfunctions, patient injuries, and interventions related to PEAK PlasmaBlade 3.0 and 4.0. The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports of PlasmaBlade adverse events from June 6, 2010, to August 30, 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to PlasmaBlade 3.0 and 4.0. A total of 384 medical device reports were identified, from which 424 adverse events were extracted. Of those, 348 (82.1%) were device malfunctions, 53 (12.5%) were patient injuries, and 23 (5.4%) were operator injuries. Device malfunctions were most frequently caused by delaminated coating (110, 25.9%), followed by ignition or fire (56, 13.2%). Operator injury was most frequently caused by thermal injury (19, 4.5%), followed by laceration (4, 0.9%). Pacemakers (22, 57.9%) were the most common devices causing interference. PEAK PlasmaBlade 3.0 and 4.0 have demonstrated utility during surgeries but are associated with adverse events. Interventions that aim to educate physicians on potential risks may help reduce the incidence of complications. Future studies with standardized reporting protocols are warranted.",

    "Title": "Breast Implant-Related Adverse Events During Mammography: An Assessment of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adverse events arising in patients with breast implants during mammography reported by the Food and Drug Administration include implant rupture, pain, and impaired visualization. However, data supporting these claims were collected in 2004, and since, newer implant generations have been developed with overall rate of implantation increasing by 48%. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to determine the current incidence of implant-related adverse events arising during mammography. METHODS: We analyzed reports regarding silicone and saline breast implants published in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 2008 and November 2018. Search terms included \"mammogram,\" \"mammography,\" \"radiograph,\" \"breast cancer screening,\" \"breast cancer test,\" and \"x-ray.\" RESULTS: Of the 20 539 implant-related adverse events available in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, 427 were retrieved using our search strategy and 41 were related to mammography. Thirty-five of identified cases (85.4%) reported implant rupture, of which 19 (54.3%) were confirmed by a healthcare professional, 9 (25.7%) were clinically confirmed by saline implant deflation, and 7 (20.0%) were unverified reports by patients. Sixteen ruptures (45.7%) occurred with silicone implants, whereas 19 ruptures (54.3%) occurred with saline. Other adverse events included pain (29.3%), change in implant appearance (14.6%), and swelling (7.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Although implant rupture, pain, change in implant appearance, and swelling may occur, minimal implant-related adverse events arise during mammography. Given the extremely low reported risk of implant rupture, this should neither prevent patients from adhering to breast cancer screening programs nor deter patients from seeking breast implants. Patients should be aware of these reported risks and discuss screening options with their breast cancer screening team.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple non-invasive modalities have become popular alternatives to surgical procedures for body contouring. OBJECTIVE: To analyze adverse events (AEs) associated with non-invasive body contouring devices reported through the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The MAUDE database were queried for AEs associated with non-invasive body contouring devices between January 2011 and June 2021. An extensive list of keywords and brand and manufacturer names was used. RESULTS: A total of 1,325 reports with 1,590 AEs were identified among 6 modalities. More than 70% were reported in the past 5 years. Cryolipolysis made up 38.3% reports, which mostly pertained to paradoxical hyperplasia and hernias. Radiofrequency had the most reports (41.9%). Like laser devices, most of their reports described burns. Focused ultrasound was commonly associated with unintentional fat loss and surface irregularities. Focused electromagnetic field resulted in only 7 reports. CONCLUSION: The analysis of present study supports previous studies concerning common local symptoms caused by these devices, but it also reveals complications not reported in previous device studies. This study highlights the importance of proper technique and adherence to device guidelines. Practitioners should be knowledgeable of potential complications from each device to both prevent and manage them accordingly.",

    "Title": "A Comparison of Patient and Device Issues Reported for Recalled Venous Stent Systems.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The first two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved stents for treatment of iliofemoral vein obstruction, Boston Scientific's Vici and BD's Venovo venous stent systems, were both recalled in early 2021 within years of entering the market. Given the recent addition of patient issues as a publicly reported variable by the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, we set forth to analyze adverse event reports in MAUDE to better characterize issues reported for each system. METHODS: MAUDE was queried for all adverse event reports for brands \"Vici\" and \"Venovo\" from their respective US FDA market approval dates to August 19, 2021. Reported device issues, patient issues, and interventions performed for each adverse event were compiled and compared using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 50 unique adverse event reports were compiled for the Vici system and 341 for the Venovo system. The most common device issue reported for the Vici system was migration (48% vs. 0%; P = 0.0001) versus activation failure in Venovo (85% vs. 4%; P = 0.0001). A significantly higher proportion of Venovo reports specified no patient complications or symptoms (90% vs. 26%; P = 0.0001), with no intervention performed (89% vs. 32%; P = 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of Vici devices were extracted (8% vs. 2%; P = 0.01), required use of a new device (26% vs. 5%; P = 0.0001), and required application of a second stent within the venous stent initially placed (28% vs. 2%; P = 0.0001). The rate of intervention with balloon expansion was not significantly different between the Vici and Venovo systems (6% vs. 2%; P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: While 2 venous stent systems were recalled simultaneously, significant differences exist between reported device issues in MAUDE and whether patient injury was involved and well described. Our data suggest that despite recent improvements to MAUDE reporting, additional standardization with specificity regarding patient issues and interventions is needed to assist vascular surgeons monitoring real-time adverse event trends for vascular devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study provides preliminary qualitative assessment of the adverse events (AEs), focusing on pelvic and abdominal AEs and patient outcomes reported for three hemostatic agents used in gynecologic surgery. METHODS: Utilization rates for oxidized regenerated cellulose powder (ORC), polysaccharide powder (PSP), and fibrin sealant solution (FSS) were obtained from hospitals via the Premier Healthcare databases for all surgical procedures from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2020. All reported cases were extracted from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for ORC and PSP and from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for FSS. Distributions of AEs by anatomical site (MAUDE/FAERS) and surgical procedures by specialty (Premier) were evaluated for each product. Number of cases and number and types of AEs were compared to the total utilization for each product. RESULTS: PSP was the most used product during the period analyzed (n = 126,509 uses), followed by FSS (n = 80,628 uses), and ORC (n = 41,583 uses). Distribution of surgical procedures by anatomical site varied significantly between hemostatic agents (p < 0.001). ORC was associated with more patient cases with AEs and numbers of reported AEs compared with PSP and FSS (p < 0.001). ORC was associated with higher number of infections than PSP (p < 0.001) and FSS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ORC use in abdominal and pelvic surgery may result in more postoperative complications compared with non-ORC hemostatic agents. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety of these products.",

    "Title": "Reported Events Associated With Spine Robots: An Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Analysis. OBJECTIVES: To summarize medical device reports (MDRs) between August 1, 2017 and November 30, 2021 relating to robot-assisted spine systems within the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database maintained by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: The MAUDE database was abstract for all MDRs relating to each FDA-approved robot-assisted spine system. Event descriptions were reviewed and characterized into specific event types. Outcome measures include specific robot-assisted spine systems and reported events as detailed by the MDRs. All data is de-identified and in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). RESULTS: There were 263 MDRs consisting of 265 reported events. Misplaced screws represented 61.5% (n = 163) of reported events. Of the 163 reported events, 57.1% (n = 93) described greater than 1 misplaced screw, 15.3% (n = 25) required return to the operating room, 8.6% (n = 14) resulted in neurologic injury, 4.3% (n = 7) resulted in dural tear, and 1.2% (n = 2) resulted in hemorrhage or bleeding. Reported events other than misplaced screws included system imprecision detected prior to screw placement (58/265, 21.9%), mechanical failure (23/265, 8.7%), and software failure (18/265, 6.8%). CONCLUSIONS: As more robot-assisted spine systems gain FDA approval and the adoption of these systems continues to grow, documenting and understanding the range of reported events associated with each \"tool\" is imperative to balancing patient safety with surgical innovation. This study of the MAUDE database provides a unique summary of reported events associated with robot-assisted spine systems that is not directly linked to a research setting.",

    "Title": "The Patient Narrative for Breast Implant Illness: A 10-Year Review of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of a condition known as breast implant illness. Very little information exists about the diagnosis and natural history of breast implant illness. To better understand the patient experience, we surveyed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for narratives describing symptoms of breast implant illness. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for all reports that included breast implant illness within the patient narrative between 2010 and 2020. A review of narratives was used to identify and summarize 36 symptoms over nine symptom classes. Event year and reporting year were summarized. Hierarchical clustering analysis using centroid components was conducted on all reported breast implant illness symptoms, and a dendrogram was created to visualize clustering. RESULTS: During the study period from 2010 to 2020, there were 751 captured adverse event reports in the MAUDE database that referenced breast implant illness, with the first report submission in 2014. Of those reports, 60.6 percent were for silicone implants and 39.4 percent were for saline implants. The three most commonly reported symptom categories were neurologic [ n = 544 (72.4 percent)], followed by musculoskeletal [ n = 418 (55.7 percent)], and dermatologic [ n = 273 (36.4 percent)]. The top 10 symptoms, irrespective of category, include fatigue/weakness, numbness/tingling, brain fog, depression/anxiety, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, hair loss, gastrointestinal issues, and weight change. A hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that symptoms reported by patients clustered into two major groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the utility of public-facing databases, such as the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, in understanding the patient experience as it relates to breast implant illness.",

    "Title": "Deep brain stimulation for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: A review and analysis of the FDA MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used as a treatment option for patients diagnosed with a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is highly resistant to conventional treatment methods. In 2009, DBS was granted a humanitarian device exemption-approval by the Food and Drug Administration after promising preliminary data. Monitoring of long-term safety data through post market surveillance of adverse events has not yet been conducted for DBS in OCD patients. This study aims to address this critical knowledge gap. METHODS: All patient- and device-related (PR; DR) reports from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2021, were downloaded and compiled from the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database pertaining to DBS for OCD using the product class name \"Deep Brain Stimulator For OCD.\" Data in this study were examined using descriptive statistics to evaluate for frequency of reporting. RESULTS: The most frequently reported PR adverse event categories included psychiatric (40%), neurological (19%), other (14%), decreased therapeutic response (10%), and infections (10%). The most frequent DR reports were high impedance (14%), energy output problem (7%), battery problem (7%), malposition of device (7%), and improper/incorrect procedure or method (7%). CONCLUSION: The PR and DR adverse events in our study align with the previous findings of adverse events. They also further solidify that DBS for refractory OCD may be a viable option for the right patient population. However, further studies are essential given the limitations of the MAUDE database.",

    "Abstract": "A technological solution for the management of diabetes in people who require intensive insulin therapy has been sought for decades. The last 10 years have seen substantial growth in devices that can be integrated into clinical care. Driven by the availability of reliable systems for continuous glucose monitoring, we have entered an era in which insulin delivery through insulin pumps can be modulated based on sensor glucose data. Over the past few years, regulatory approval of the first automated insulin delivery (AID) systems has been granted, and these systems have been adopted into clinical care. Additionally, a community of people living with type 1 diabetes has created its own systems using a do-it-yourself approach by using products commercialised for independent use. With several AID systems in development, some of which are anticipated to be granted regulatory approval in the near future, the joint Diabetes Technology Working Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association has created this consensus report. We provide a review of the current landscape of AID systems, with a particular focus on their safety. We conclude with a series of recommended targeted actions. This is the fourth in a series of reports issued by this working group. The working group was jointly commissioned by the executives of both organisations to write the first statement on insulin pumps, which was published in 2015. The original authoring group was comprised by three nominated members of the American Diabetes Association and three nominated members of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Additional authors have been added to the group to increase diversity and range of expertise. Each organisation has provided a similar internal review process for each manuscript prior to submission for editorial review by the two journals. Harmonisation of editorial and substantial modifications has occurred at both levels. The members of the group have selected the subject of each statement and submitted the selection to both organisations for confirmation.",

    "Title": "Association Between Device Type and Type IIIb Endoleaks Following Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Endoleaks following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) can lead to the need for re-intervention and aortic rupture. Given the recent recall of a specific thoracic stent graft type due to concerns about type IIIb endoleak (T3bE), in which blood leaks through the stent graft fabric, the aim was to characterise patterns of T3bEs among available TEVAR devices. METHODS: Reports related to thoracic stent grafts in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed. Proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) and chi squared tests were used to assess for the presence of a signal of association between device type and T3bE. A PRR > 2 and chi squared value > 4 with three or more reports overall constituted a signal of association. The institutional database of patients undergoing TEVAR for thoracic aneurysms since 2002 was also queried for T3bE. RESULTS: There were 7 328 MAUDE reports available for analysis. When analysing T3bEs in the MAUDE database, the lowest PRR was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0 - 1.03 in Gore CTAG, nine T3bE among 1 328 reports) and the highest was 2.07 (95% CI 1.72 - 2.42 in Medtronic Valiant, 64 T3bE among 2 520 reports). The T3bE chi squared value for Medtronic Valiant was 17.3. The relationship between Medtronic Valiant and T3bE was ascertainable by MAUDE data as early as 2013. Among 542 TEVARs for an aneurysm indication at Duke University Hospital since 2002, there were eight T3bEs - all in devices with sutured on graft material. CONCLUSION: The Medtronic Valiant device met criteria for association with type IIIb endoleaks in the FDA's MAUDE database and met those criteria as early as 2013. A possible relationship between woven graft fabric and T3bEs is supported by the observation that all types of T3bE that occurred among a large number of TEVARs at the institution followed placement of grafts with sutured on woven fabric.",

    "Title": "Patient-related adverse events and device failures associated with commercially available enteral or duodenal self-expanding metal stents: an analysis of the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Duodenal stents are widely used to treat patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (MGOO), most commonly from pancreatic cancer. The WallFlex (Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass, USA) and Evolution (Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, NC, USA) duodenal stents are in widespread use for treating MGOO. The objective of this study was to analyze device failures and patient-related adverse events reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for these 2 stents. METHODS: We analyzed postmarketing surveillance data on the WallFlex and Evolution duodenal stents from January 2000 to January 2022 through the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfmaude/search.cfm). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four MAUDE reports were identified and analyzed, from which 176 device failures and 186 patient-related adverse events were identified. Device-related failures for the WallFlex stent were delivery system failure (15.4%) and failure to activate the stent (13.2%). Device failures for the Evolution stent were failure to activate the stent (16.5%) and delivery system failure (15.3%). Patient-related adverse events for the WallFlex stent were perforation (18.9%), death (6.6%), and hemorrhage (3.8%), whereas patient-related adverse events for the Evolution duodenal stent were obstruction (16.3%), perforation (6.3%), aspiration (3.8%), and fragments of broken delivery system left in the patient (3.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Both stents are associated with device failures such as failure to activate the stent, stent migration, and occlusion by tumor growth. Despite high success rates, duodenal stents can be associated with serious device failures and patient-related adverse events.",

    "Title": "Safe design of surgical robots - a systematic approach to comprehensive hazard identification.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Since the 1980s, robotic arms have been transferred from industrial applications to orthopaedic surgical robotics. Adverse events are frequent and often associated with the adopted powerful and oversized anthropomorphic arms. The FDA's 510(k) pathway encourages building on such systems, leading to the adoption of hazards, which is known as \"predicate creep\". Additionally, the methodology of hazard identification for medical device development needs improvement. METHODS: We present an approach to enhance general hazard identification and prevent hazards of predicate creep by using the integrative, scenario-based and multi-perspective Point-of-View (PoV) approach. We also present the Catalogue of Hazards (CoH) as an approach for collecting and systematising hazards for future risk analysis and robot development. RESULTS: We applied seven predefined PoVs to the use case of robotic laminectomy and identified 133 hazards, mainly coming from HMI analysis and literature. By analysing the MAUDE and recalls databases of the FDA, we were able to classify historical hazards and adopt them into the use case. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PoV approach and CoH is suitable for integrating multiple established hazard identification methods, increasing comprehensiveness, and supporting the systematic and hazard-based development of surgical robots.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite fire prevention protocols and perioperative staff training, surgical fires continue to cause patient harm, disability, and death. METHODS: We identified surgical fires that were reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 2000 and 2020 that resulted in patient or surgical personnel harm. Quantitative and descriptive content analyses were performed on free-text responses to identify contributing factors of surgical fire patient and personnel harm events. RESULTS: We identified 565 surgical fire events resulting in patient or surgical personnel harm over a 20-year study period (median 25 events/year; range, 8-53). Surgical fires were significantly more likely to occur during upper aerodigestive tract (unadjusted odds ratio 15.96; 95% confidence interval, 11.93-21.34) and head and neck (unadjusted odds ratio 5.47; confidence interval 4.14-7.22) procedures compared with abdomen and pelvis procedures. Upper aerodigestive tract and head and neck procedures had the highest incidence of life-threatening injury (41% and 21%, respectively). An electrosurgical device was the ignition source in 82% of events. Content analysis revealed 7 common categories identified as root causes of surgical fires: preparation of surgical site (n = 55, 29%); device malfunction (n = 51, 26%), surgical accident (n = 47, 24%), medical judgement (n = 44 reports, 23%), equipment care and handling (n = 18, 9%), patient factors (n = 10, 5%), and communication (n = 3, 2%). CONCLUSION: Surgical fires resulting in harm to patient and surgical personnel continue to occur. The common themes identified in this study will prepare and empower surgeons and surgical personnel to prevent surgical fires in the future.",

    "Title": "Laryngology Outcomes Following Implantable Vagus Nerve Stimulation.",
    "Abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices have gained widespread acceptance for treatment of resistant epilepsy and depression. The increasing number of procedures has resulted in an increasing number of iatrogenic injuries to the vagus nerve, which can have a significant effect on vocalization and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative frequency of laryngeal adverse effects reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after VNS implantation and to analyze associated VNS device problems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional analysis queried the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database of adverse events in the US between 1996 and 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the percent of adverse events reported to the FDA that included patients who received VNS with laryngeal adverse effects and the associated proportion of device problems after VNS surgery. RESULTS: A total of 12 725 iatrogenic vagus nerve issues were documented after VNS implantation, with apnea (n = 395; 3.1%) being the most common patient problem. Overall, 187 reports of laryngeal adverse effects associated with VNS devices were identified and represented the eighth most common iatrogenic vagus nerve problem reported to the FDA. Laryngeal adverse effects included 78 reports of voice alteration and 57 reports of paresis/paralysis. The VNS device problems frequently associated with laryngeal adverse effects were high impedance (n = 15, 8.02%), incorrect frequency delivery (n = 10, 5.35%), and battery problems (n = 11, 5.88%). The number of laryngeal adverse effect reports per year peaked in 2012 with 43 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that although the literature demonstrates that vocal changes occur with nearly all VNS devices, the FDA receives adverse event reports of voice changes. Our results emphasize a potential need to improve patient counseling prior to VNS surgery to better set patient expectations regarding vocal changes and to prevent unnecessary patient concern. In addition, reports of vocal fold paresis/paralysis potentially suggest that patients may benefit from preoperative laryngeal assessment to differentiate preexisting vocal fold paralysis from that caused by VNS surgery.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Polyethylene-Related Revisions After Total Ankle Replacements Reported in US Food and Drug Administration Medical Device Adverse Event Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are 2 general types of total ankle replacement (TAR) designs with respect to the polyethylene insert, mobile-bearing (MB) and fixed-bearing (FB) TARs. The aim of this study is to compare polyethylene-related adverse events (AEs), particularly revisions, reported for MB TARs and FB TARs using the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A text mining method was applied to the medical device reporting (MDR) in the MAUDE database from 1991 to 2020, followed by manual reviews to identify, characterize, and describe all polyethylene-related AEs, including revisions, reported for MB and FB TARs. RESULTS: We found 1841 MDRs for MB (STAR Ankle only) and 1273 MDRs for 40+ FB TARs approved/cleared by the FDA. For the MB design, 33% (606/1841) of the AEs reported related to the polyethylene component, compared to 24% (291/1273) of the AEs reported for FB designs. Polyethylene fractures were reported in 11.3% (208/1841) for the MB designs compared to 0.2% (2/1273) for the FB designs. Half of the polyethylene-related revisions occurred within an average of 4.1 years after implantation for the MB design compared within an average of 5.2 years for FB designs. CONCLUSION: Analysis of this database revealed a higher proportion of reported polyethylene fractures and greater need for earlier revisions for polyethylene-related issues with use of the primary MB design in the database as compared with FB TAR designs. Further study of device-related complications with more recent designs for both MB and FB ankle replacement components are needed to improve the outcomes of total ankle replacement. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flexible cystoscopes can be multi-use devices that visually inspect genitourinary structures such as the bladder and urethra. The objective of this study is to characterize the adverse events and associated device malfunctions of reusable flexible cystoscopes and to provide information on contamination and post-procedural infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for all adverse events and device malfunctions related to the use of flexible cystoscopes between January 2015 and December 2020. The MAUDE adverse event classification system was used to standardize the severity of complications and special focus was taken to identify clusters of events related to a single device. RESULTS: A total of 335 adverse events related to flexible cystoscopes were identified. Most adverse events associated with patient harm were caused by infection (n = 121), which included 19 cases of sepsis, one ICU admission, and one death. Among the infections, 29 cases showed growth of the same organism in both the device and patient. There were five infectious outbreaks identified and each outbreak was attributed to a single cystoscope. Other adverse events included mechanical malfunction (n = 6) and allergic reaction (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the risk of post-procedural infection associated with flexible cystoscope contamination. Further studies are needed to characterize the prevalence and incidence of flexible cystoscope contamination and to develop strategies to prevent post-procedural infection.",

Using queried events from October 2013 to December 2020 from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, we analyzed the Angiosculpt scoring balloon catheter complication rates and mode of failure. A total of 248 complications were reported. Most reported complications occurred in the superficial femoral artery (SFA) (19.4%, n = 48), followed by the left anterior descending artery (8.1%, n = 20). Severe vessel calcifications were reported in (26.6%, n = 66) of the complications. Most complications occurred with damage to the device, such as tip break (44.8%, n = 111) and balloon rupture (26.6%, n = 66). Some complications were due to difficulties in the withdrawal of the catheter (23.8%, n = 59). Balloon rupture is observed at a significantly higher rate amongst calcified vessels (60.6% vs 14.8%), P = < 0.001, and in cases involving the SFA (39.4% vs 11.3%), P = < 0.001. All-cause complications in calcified vessels are associated with the SFA (39.4% vs 12.5%), P = < 0.001, and left anterior descending artery (16.7% vs 5.1%), P = < 0.001. The Angiosculpt scoring balloon catheter has a relatively low complication rate. Most complications were associated with a device tip break, balloon rupture, and difficulties in withdrawal in severely calcified vessels.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Surgical staplers and clip appliers are commonly used and have a potential to malfunction, which may result in serious injury or death. These events are self-reported to the Food and Drug Administration and compiled in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. This study characterizes mortality related to surgical stapler and clip applier failure reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was reviewed between 1992 and 2016 for medical device reports related to surgical staplers and clip appliers filed under the following product codes: GAG, FZP, GDO, GDW, KOG, and GCJ. Adverse events including death and the type of device failure were reviewed. Temporal trends in reported deaths related to device failure were analyzed and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database was used to adjust for annual surgical case volume using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 75,415 malfunctions, 21,115 injuries, and 676 deaths were associated with the use of surgical stapler and clip applier devices. Most deaths occurred postoperatively (N = 516, 76.3%) and were due to infection/sepsis (N = 89, 17.2%) or vascular injuries (N = 110, 21.3%). Intraoperative mortality (N = 79, 11.7%) was primarily due to vascular injuries (N = 73, 92.4%). Device failures resulting in death were noted both intraoperatively (N = 268, 39.6%) and postoperatively (N = 325, 48.1%). In post hoc root cause analysis, a surgical stapler and clip applier device problem was the most common attributed cause of death (N = 238, 65.4%). In the linear regression analysis, there was a significant increase in the mortality from device failure in the study period after adjusting for annual surgical volume (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Mortality related to the use of surgical staplers and clip appliers is increasing. Most deaths occurred postoperatively, and an increased awareness of potential life-threatening complications is warranted when these devices are used.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To explore the clinical consequences and potential root causes of insulin pump-associated adverse events (AEs) reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Research Design and Methods: Qualitative template analysis of narrative data in a 20% stratified random sample (n = 2429) of reported AEs that occurred during the first 6 months of 2020 involving five insulin pump models marketed at that time: (1) MiniMed™ 670G, (2) MiniMed™ 630G, (3) Omnipod®, (4) Omnipod DASH®, and (5) t:slim X2™. Results: Of the 2429 AEs, 92% included a clinical consequence in the narrative description, with critical hyperglycemia (i.e., blood glucose [BG] >400 mg/dL; 47%) and critical hypoglycemia (i.e., BG <54 mg/dL; 24%) being the most common consequence cited. Only 50% of the AE narratives included information to support the identification of a root cause. The most cited root cause informing remarks were issues with the pump or pod reservoir/cartridge (9%), the occurrence of an obstruction of flow alarm (8%), and problems with the infusion set or site (8%). Some clinical consequences and root cause informing remarks were cited more frequently in AE narratives involving specific insulin pump models, but manufacturer variability in the amount and type of information reported may have affected these findings. Conclusions: Our findings show general themes found in insulin pump-associated AE that providers can use to raise patient awareness of potential risks associated with insulin pump use and develop strategies to prevent future AEs. Improvements in AE investigation and reporting processes are still necessary.",

    "Title": "An Analysis of a Decade of Lumbar Interbody Cage Failures in the United States: A MAUDE Database Study.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the rates of lumbar interbody cage failures based on their material and manufacturer. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Perioperative lumbar interbody cage malfunctions are underreported events in the spine literature and may result in complications. Although the Food and Drug Administration ensures the safety of these devices under physiological conditions after implantation, these devices may experience nonphysiological conditions during implantation, which may be overlooked. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was examined for reports of lumbar cage device malfunctions from 2012 to 2021. Each report was categorized based on failure type and implant design. A market analysis was performed by dividing the total number of failures per year for each manufacturer by their approximate yearly revenue from spinal implants in the United States. Outlier analysis was performed to generate a threshold value above which failure rates were defined as greater than the normal index. RESULTS: Overall, 1875 lumbar cage malfunctions were identified. Of these, 1230 (65.6%) were cage breakages, 257 (13.7%) were instrument malfunctions, 177 (9.4%) were cage migrations, 143 (7.6%) were assembly failures, 70 (4.5%) were screw-related failures, and 21 (1.1%) were cage collapses. Of the breakages, 923 (74.9%) occurred during insertion or impaction and 97 entries detailed a medical complication or a retained foreign body. Of the migrations, 155 (88.6%) were identified postoperatively, of which 73 (47.1%) detailed complications and 52 (33.5%) required a revision procedure. Market analysis demonstrated that Medtronic, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Seaspine, and K2M exceeded the calculated threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar cages with polyether ether ketone core material failed more frequently by breakage, whereas titanium surface cages failed more frequently by migration. Failure rates varied depending on the manufacturer. Most cage breakages identified in the present study occurred intraoperatively during implantation. These findings call for a more detailed Food and Drug Administration evaluation of these intraoperative malfunctions before commercial approval. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events of Endoscopic Clip Placement: A MAUDE Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clips are endoscopic mechanical devices with tensile and closure strength that can approximate tissue and provide hemostasis through a tamponade effect. Clips are ubiquitously used in endoscopic practice, and numerous studies have validated the clinical efficacy of clips, with recent guidelines recommending them as a first-line intervention for recurrent and persistent nonvariceal gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the safety profile for these devices has yet to be delineated, thus, we aim to investigate this feature by examining the adverse events reported to the Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: Postmarketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience database were analyzed from January 2012 to January 2021. The Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience database is a reporting software and does not independently verify the details of complications. RESULTS: Two thousand five hundred forty reports were issued, of which 287 were patient adverse events and 2766 were device problems. Activation, separation, and positioning issues were most common. No consequences or clinically significant impact on patients were seen in 1968 reports. Foreign bodies were seen in 97 cases, hemorrhage in 57 cases, tissue damage in 42 cases, embedded clips in tissues/plaques in 16 cases, perforation in 15 cases, lacerations in 6 cases, and infection in 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: While the most commonly reported device problems involved activation, separation, and positioning, most patients were clinically unaffected. Moreover, perforation and infection were exceedingly rare, further highlighting the safety profile of endoscopic clips.",

    "Title": "Facial Dermal Filler Injection and Vaccination: A 12-Year Review of Adverse Event Reporting and Literature Review.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Following authorization of 2 COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020, media attention increased towards postvaccine adverse events (AEs) in patients with facial dermal filler injections. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize vaccine-related facial dermal filler AEs by scrutinizing the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 1, 2011 to January 28, 2023 for facial dermal filler medical device reports (MDRs) discussing vaccination-related AEs. A PubMed (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) literature review on dermal filler AEs was then conducted. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 10,637 MDRs identified, 33 were included. There were 25 MDRs (75.8%) related to COVID-19 vaccination. Hyaluronic acid-based fillers were described in 31 MDRs (93.9%). AEs were mostly reported within days postinjection (n = 7, 21.2%), but ranged from immediately (n = 2, 6.1%) to months (n = 6, 18.2%) postinjection. Most AEs were reported postvaccine (n = 17, 51.5%) vs postfiller (n = 14, 42.4%). In 26 reports (78.8%), AEs occurred at the site of filler injection. Most MDRs described inflammation/swelling (n = 21, 28.0%). The literature review returned 302 articles, of which 14 were included. Only 1 article (7.1%) was published in a plastic surgery journal. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic brought attention to COVID-19 vaccine-related facial dermal filler AEs, this study shows a low incidence compared with the millions of vaccine and filler injections administered. Reactions with non-COVID-19 vaccines were also documented. Increased awareness may help providers counsel patients undergoing vaccination and dermal filler implantation.",

    "Title": "Analysis of reported adverse events of pipeline stents for intracranial aneurysms using the FDA MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Flow diverting stents (FDS) are a validated device in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, allowing for minimally invasive intervention. However, after its approval for use in the United States in 2011, post-market surveillance of adverse events is limited. This study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by analyzing the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for patient and device related (PR and DR) reports of adverse events and malfunctions. METHODS: Using post-market surveillance data from the MAUDE database, PR and DR reports from January 2012-December 2021 were extracted, compiled, and analyzed with R-Studio version 2021.09.2. PR and DR reports with insufficient information were excluded. Raw information was organized, and further author generated classifications were created for both PR and DR reports. RESULTS: A total of 2203 PR and 4017 DR events were recorded. The most frequently reported PR adverse event categories were cerebrovascular (60%), death (11%), and neurological (8%). The most frequent PR adverse event reports were death (11%), thrombosis/thrombus (9%) cerebral infarction (8%), decreased therapeutic response (7%), stroke/cerebrovascular accident (6%), intracranial hemorrhage (5%), aneurysm (4%), occlusion (4%), headache (4%), neurological deficit/dysfunction (3%). The most frequent DR reports were activation/positioning/separation problems (52%), break (9%), device operates differently than expected (4%), difficult to open or close (4%), material deformation (3%), migration or expulsion of device (3%), detachment of device or device component (2%). CONCLUSIONS: Post-market surveillance is important to guide patient counselling and identify adverse events and device problems that were not identified in initial trials. We present frequent reports of several types of cerebrovascular and neurological adverse events as well as the most common device shortcomings that should be explored by manufacturers and future studies. Although inherent limitations to the MAUDE database are present, our results highlight important PR and DR complications that can help optimize patient counseling and device development.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Reported Adverse Events Associated with Over-the-Scope Endoscopic Suturing System: an FDA MAUDE Database Study.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The over-the-scope endoscopic suturing system (ESS) (OverStitch™) is one of the most widely utilized endoscopic suturing systems in current clinical practice; however, data on the adverse events associated with this device is scarce. Our study aims to evaluate the adverse events and complications associated with the over-the-scope ESS using the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA MAUDE database for the over-the-scope ESS from January 2008 through June 2022. RESULTS: Eighty-three reports were filed from January 2008 to June 2022. Adverse events were classified as device-related complications and patient-related adverse events. Seventy-seven device-related issues and 87 patient adverse events were identified. The most common device-related issue was difficulty to remove after deployment (n=12, 15.58%) followed by mechanical problem (n=10, 12.99%), mechanical jam (n=9, 11.69%), or entrapment of device (n=9, 11.69%). Of the 87 patient-related adverse events, the most common was perforation (n=19; 21.84%), followed by device embedded in tissue or plaque (n=10; 11.49%), and abdominal pain (n=8; 9.20%). Of the 19 patients who experienced perforation, two required open surgical repair and one required laparoscopic surgical repair. CONCLUSION: The overall adverse events from the over-the-scope ESS remain acceptable as evidenced by the number of reported cases since 2008. However, it is important to note that adverse event rates might increase as the use of the device increases; therefore, it is essential for endoscopists to be aware of the potential common and rare adverse events associated with the use of the over-the-scope ESS device.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrapulmonary placements of feeding tubes inserted with use of an electromagnetic placement device (EMPD) continue to occur. OBJECTIVE: To describe circumstances and outcomes associated with intrapulmonary feeding tube placements during use of an EMPD. METHODS: A retrospective review of reports to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of intrapulmonary feeding tube placements during use of an EMPD from 2019 through 2021. Complications, outcomes, operator training, interference from anatomical variations and medical devices, and the use and accuracy of radiographs in identifying pulmonary placements were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-two cases of intrapulmonary tube placement were identified; 10 were associated with a fatal outcome. Pneumothorax occurred in 35 cases and feedings were delivered into the lung in 11 cases. User error was cited in 6 cases and was implicit in most others. Little information was provided about operator training. Four intrapulmonary placements were associated with anatomical variations and 1 with a left ventricular assist device. Radiographic follow-up was described in 28 cases and correctly identified 23 of the intrapulmonary placements. CONCLUSIONS: User error was a significant factor, which highlights the need for empirical data to clarify the amount of training needed to safely credential EMPD operators. Clearer information is needed about anatomical variations that may contraindicate use of an EMPD, as well as medical devices that may interfere with an EMPD. Use of follow-up radiographs, interpreted by qualified personnel, is supported to increase the probability of identifying intrapulmonary tube placements.",

    "Title": "Metal-Free Cortico-Pedicular Device for Supplemental Fixation in Lumbar Interbody Fusion.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Pedicle screw fixation is a commonly utilized adjunct for lumbar interbody fusion, yet risks include screw malposition, pullout, loosening, neurovascular injury, and stress transfers leading to adjacent segment degeneration. This report describes the preclinical and initial clinical results of a minimally invasive, metal-free cortico-pedicular fixation device used for supplemental posterior fixation in lumbar interbody fusion. METHODS: Safety of arcuate tunnel creation was evaluated in cadaveric lumbar (L1-S1) specimens. A finite element analysis study evaluated clinical stability of the device to pedicular screw-rod fixation at L4-L5. Preliminary clinical results were assessed by analysis of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database complications, and 6-month outcomes in 13 patients treated with the device. RESULTS: Among 35 curved drill holes in 5 lumbar specimens, no breaches of the anterior cortex were identified. The mean minimum distance from the anterior surface of the hole to the spinal canal ranged from 5.1 mm at L1-L2 to 9.8 mm at L5-S1. In the finite element analysis study, the polyetheretherketone strap provided comparable clinical stability and reduced anterior stress shielding compared to the conventional screw-rod construct. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database identified 1 device fracture with no clinical sequelae among 227 procedures. Initial clinical experience showed a 53% decrease in pain severity (P = 0.009), a 50% decrease in Oswestry Disability Index (P < 0.001), and no device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Cortico-pedicular fixation is a safe and reproducible procedure that may address limitations of pedicle screw fixation. Longer term clinical data in large clinical studies are recommended to confirm these promising early results.",

    "Title": "Assessment of adverse events for a home-use intense pulsed light hair removal device using postmarketing surveillance.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Home-use intense pulsed light (IPL) hair removal devices are convenient for consumers. Consumer safety associated with home-use IPL devices, however, remains a subject of interest. In this descriptive analysis, we assessed the most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) for a home-use IPL device from postmarketing surveillance and qualitatively compared these with AEs from clinical studies and medical device reports of home-use IPL treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this analysis of voluntary reports, we queried a distributor's postmarketing database for IPL devices for the period beginning January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021. All sources of comments, for example, phone, e-mail, company-sponsored web sites, were included in the analysis. AE data were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Also, we conducted a PubMed search to identify AE profiles from existing literature on home-use IPL devices and we searched the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reports on home-use IPL devices. These results were qualitatively compared to the data in the postmarketing surveillance database. RESULTS: A total of 1692 cases involving IPL were identified from voluntary reports of AEs between 2016 and 2021. The shipment-adjusted reporting rate for AE cases (number of AE cases/100,000 shipped IPL devices) was 67/100,000 during this 6-year period. The most commonly reported AEs were pain of skin 27.8% (470/1692), \"thermal burn\" 18.7% (316/1692), and erythema 16.0% (271/1692). Among the top 25 AEs reported, no unexpected health events were observed. The reported AEs were qualitatively similar to the pattern seen in clinical studies and the MAUDE database associated with such home-use IPL treatments. CONCLUSION: This is the first such report documenting AEs for home-use IPL hair removal from a postmarketing surveillance program. These data are supportive of the safety of such home-use low-fluence IPL technology.",

    "Abstract": "Bioabsorbable implants (eg, Latera) have recently been approved for addressing nasal valve collapse. The purpose of this study is to summarize adverse events and treatment sequelae associated with bioabsorbable nasal implants queried in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Of the 26 device reports entered between March 2017 and April 2022, the most frequently reported complications included abscess (n = 13) and implant protrusion (n = 5). Other common symptoms reported greater than 1-year postimplantation included facial pain/discomfort (n = 3) and failure to absorb (n = 3). Management of adverse events included treatment with antibiotics (n = 9), steroid injections (n = 4), and explantation (n = 20). In 3 reports, adverse reactions required a biopsy of adjacent tissue for pathologic analysis. These findings suggest that further research is required to assess the potential long-term complications and optimize the management of bioabsorbable nasal implants. Furthermore, standardized reporting templates may improve the utility of the MAUDE database.",

    "Title": "Are all Cages Created Equal? Analysis of Cervical Cage Malfunctions Using FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. OBJECTIVE: To characterize failure rates of cervical cages based on manufacturer and design characteristics using the nationwide database of reported malfunctions. BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aims to ensure the safety and efficacy of cervical interbody implants postimplantation; however, intraoperative malfunctions may be overlooked. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of cervical cage device malfunctions from 2012 to 2021. Each report was categorized based on the failure type, implant design, and manufacturer. Two market analyses were performed. First, \"failure-to-market share indices\" were generated by dividing the number of failures per year for each implant material by its yearly US market share in cervical spine fusion. Second, \"failure-to-revenue indices\" were calculated by dividing the total number of failures per year for each manufacturer by their approximate yearly revenue from spinal implants in the US. Outlier analysis was performed to generate a threshold value above which failure rates were defined as greater than the normal index. RESULTS: In total, 1336 entries were identified, and 1225 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 354 (28.9%) were cage breakages, 54 (4.4%) were cage migrations, 321 (26.2%) were instrumentation-related failures, 301 (24.6%) were assembly failures, and 195 (15.9%) were screw failures. Poly-ether-ether-ketone implants had higher failure by market share indices for both migration and breakage compared with titanium. Upon manufacturer market analysis, Seaspine, Zimmer-Biomet, K2M, and LDR exceeded the failure threshold. CONCLUSION: The most common cause of implant malfunction was breakage. Poly-ether-ether-ketone cages were more likely to break and migrate compared with titanium ones. Many of these implant failures occurred intraoperatively during instrumentation, which underscores the need for FDA evaluation of these implants and their accompanying instrumentation under the appropriate loading conditions before commercial approval.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Harmonic Focus (Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Cincinnati, OH, USA), LigaSure Small Jaw (Medtronic, Covidien Products, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and Thunderbeat Open Fine Jaw (Olympus, Japan) are electrosurgical instruments used widely in head and neck surgery. The study aims to compare device malfunctions, adverse events to patients, operative injuries, and interventions related to Harmonic, LigaSure, and Thunderbeat use during thyroidectomy. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for adverse events associated with Harmonic, LigaSure, and Thunderbeat from January 2005 to August 2020. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to thyroidectomy. RESULTS: Of the 620 adverse events extracted, 394 (63.5%) involved Harmonic, 134 (21.6%) LigaSure, and 92 (14.8%) Thunderbeat. The reported device malfunctions most frequently associated with Harmonic was damage to the blade (110 (27.9%)), LigaSure was inappropriate function (47 (43.1%)), Thunderbeat was damage to the tissue or Teflon pad (27 (30.7%)), respectively. Burn injury and incomplete hemostasis were the most commonly reported adverse events. The operative injury reported most frequently when using Harmonic and LigaSure was burn injury. No operator injuries were reported with Thunderbeat use. CONCLUSION: The most frequently reported device malfunctions were damage to the blade, inappropriate function, and damage to the tissue or Teflon pad. The most frequently reported adverse events to patients was a burn injury and incomplete hemostasis. Interventions aimed at improving physician education may help reduce adverse events attributed to improper use.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Angiographic equipment is a key component of healthcare infrastructure, used for endovascular procedures throughout the body. The literature on adverse events related to this technology is limited. The purpose of this study was to analyze adverse events related to angiographic devices from the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Methods: MAUDE data on angiographic imaging equipment from July 2011 to July 2021 were extracted. Qualitative content analysis was performed, a typology of adverse events was derived, and this was used to classify the data. Outcomes were assessed using the Healthcare Performance Improvement (HPI) and Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) adverse event classifications. Results: There were 651 adverse events reported. Most were near misses (67%), followed by precursor safety events (20.5%), serious safety events (11.2%), and unclassifiable (1.2%). Events impacted patients (42.1%), staff (3.2%), both (1.2%), or neither (53.5%). The most common events associated with patient harm were intra-procedure system shut down, foot pedal malfunction, table movement malfunction, image quality deterioration, patient falls, and fluid damage to system. Overall, 34 (5.2%) events were associated with patient death; 18 during the procedure and 5 during patient transport to another angiographic suite/hospital due to critical failure of equipment. Conclusion: Adverse events related to angiographic equipment are rare; however, serious adverse events and deaths have been reported. This study has defined a typology of the most common adverse events associated with patient and staff harm. Increased understanding of these failures may lead to improved product design, user training, and departmental contingency planning.",

    "Title": "Device Failure and Adverse Events Related to Single-use and Reusable Flexible Ureteroscopes: Findings and New Insights From an 11-Year Analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To catalog and characterize device failures and adverse events related to flexible ureteroscopes from a national database. METHODS: Search of the Manufacturer User and Facility Device Experience database was performed for all recorded events related to flexible ureteroscopes between 2012 and 2022. The following information was collected: Problem and cause, timing, complications and injury, prolonged anesthesia, and early termination of procedure. Event severity was graded using a validated tool. RESULTS: A total of 206 events were identified (reusable/single use ratio, 2.5:1). There were 20 different problem categories reported, which included image loss (26.7%), difficulty removing scope (13.6%), scope damage from basket (4.4%), detachment of scope tip (5.8%) and contamination (4.9%). Faulty device was the predominant cause for an event related to single-use scopes (86.4%); this was seldom the case for reusable (2%). Patient injury occurred in 21.8%, but these were all in reusable scopes. No deaths were reported, but major complications included complete avulsion of the ureter (3.4%) and fully entrapped scope necessitating open surgery (2.9%). While the safety profile for single-use scopes was superior, they were significantly more likely to result in early termination (71.1% vs 37.3%, P < .001). This was related to 76.3% of the single-use scopes experiencing sudden image loss. CONCLUSION: Flexible ureteroscopes are fragile, and a multitude of problems can occur. Many of these can be avoided through correct surgeon technique and robust maintenance services.",

    "Title": "More than algorithms: an analysis of safety events involving ML-enabled medical devices reported to the FDA.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the real-world safety problems involving machine learning (ML)-enabled medical devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 266 safety events involving approved ML medical devices reported to the US FDA's MAUDE program between 2015 and October 2021. Events were reviewed against an existing framework for safety problems with Health IT to identify whether a reported problem was due to the ML device (device problem) or its use, and key contributors to the problem. Consequences of events were also classified. RESULTS: Events described hazards with potential to harm (66%), actual harm (16%), consequences for healthcare delivery (9%), near misses that would have led to harm if not for intervention (4%), no harm or consequences (3%), and complaints (2%). While most events involved device problems (93%), use problems (7%) were 4 times more likely to harm (relative risk 4.2; 95% CI 2.5-7). Problems with data input to ML devices were the top contributor to events (82%). DISCUSSION: Much of what is known about ML safety comes from case studies and the theoretical limitations of ML. We contribute a systematic analysis of ML safety problems captured as part of the FDA's routine post-market surveillance. Most problems involved devices and concerned the acquisition of data for processing by algorithms. However, problems with the use of devices were more likely to harm. CONCLUSIONS: Safety problems with ML devices involve more than algorithms, highlighting the need for a whole-of-system approach to safe implementation with a special focus on how users interact with devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The BRAVO pH monitor system can benefit patients with ongoing GERD symptoms despite treatment and/or atypical symptoms. We aim to investigate the number and type of complications associated with the BRAVO pH capsule. METHODS: From April 2016 through February 2021, we analyzed post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. RESULTS: During the study period, approximately 1,651 reports were identified with 2391 cases associated with a device failure, and 254 reporting a patient-related adverse event. Most device complications were due to aspiration n = 153), followed by reported pain (n = 79), injury (unspecified) (n = 63), and additional radiologic imaging (n = 44). Laceration and bleeding accounted for 29 and 19 cases. Furthermore, three patients suffered perforation. Most device failures were due to loss or failure of the Bravo capsule to bond or adhere to the esophageal mucosa as planned (n = 1269), followed by an activation or positioning failure (n = 972), premature detachment of device (n = 284), and failure of the device to record or transmit data (n = 158). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database highlight the risk of aspiration, hemorrhage/bleeding, perforation, injury, and retention as potential complications of BRAVO capsule placement.",

    "Title": "Comparing nationally reported adverse events associated with coblation vs. PlasmaBlade for tonsillectomy.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE(S): Coblation, or radiofrequency ablation, and pulsed-electron avalanche knife (PEAK) plasmablade are newer approaches for tonsillectomy that reduce exposure to thermal heat. This study aims to describe and compare adverse events related to these devices for tonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports involving coblation devices and the PEAK plasmablade from 2011 to 2021. Data were extracted from reports pertaining to tonsillectomy with and without adenoidectomy. RESULTS: There were 331 reported adverse events for coblation and 207 for the plasmablade. For coblation, 53 (16.0 %) of these involved patients and 278 (84.0 %) were device malfunctions. Similarly for the plasmablade, 22 (10.6 %) involved patients and 185 (89.4 %) were device malfunctions. The most frequent patient-related adverse event was burn injury, which was significantly more common with the plasmablade compared to coblation (77.3 % vs. 50.9 %, respectively, p = 0.042). For both the coblator and plasmablade, the most common device malfunction was intraoperative tip or wire damage (16.9 % vs. 27.0 %, respectively, p = 0.010). The Plasmablade tip caught fire in five reports (2.7 %) with one causing burn injury. CONCLUSIONS: While coblation devices and the plasmablade have demonstrated utility in tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, they are associated with adverse events. Plasmablade use may require greater caution for intraoperative fires and patient burn injuries compared to coblation use. Interventions to improve physician comfort with these devices may help reduce adverse events and inform preoperative discussions with patients.",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with AveirTM VR leadless pacemaker: A Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database study.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemaker (LP) offers an innovative approach for treating bradyarrhythmia, thus avoiding pacemaker pocket and lead-related complications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved the Aveir™ leadless pacing system (screw-in type LP). METHODS: We queried the FDA MAUDE database to study the safety profile and assess the types of complications with this relatively novel device technology. A MAUDE database search was conducted on January 20, 2023, for reports received post-FDA approval to capture all adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 98 medical device report were reported for Aveir™ LP. After excluding duplicate, programmer-related, or introducer-sheath-related entries (n = 34), 64 entries were included. The most commonly encountered problem was high threshold/noncapture (28.1%, 18 events), followed by stretched helix (17.2%, 11 events) and device dislodgement (15.6%, ten events-5 intraprocedural, while 5 in the postoperative Day 1). Other reported events included high impedance (14.1%, nine events), sensing issues (12.5%, eight events), bent/broken helix (7.8%, five events), premature separation (4.7%, three events), interrogation problem (3.1%, two events), low impedance (3.1%, two events), premature battery depletion (1.6%, one event) and inadvertent MRI mode switch (1.6%, one event) and miscellaneous (15.6%, n = 10). There were eight serious patient injury events-pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis (7.8%, five events) due to cardiac perforation that resulted in two deaths (3.1%) followed by sustained ventricular arrhythmias (4.6%, n = 3). CONCLUSION: In our study assessing the real-world safety profile of the Aveir™ LP, serious adverse events have been reported-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, device explantation/reimplantation, and death.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: MAUDE database houses medical device reports of suspected device-related complications received by Food and Drug Administration. In the present study we aim to evaluate the MAUDE database for reported complications of MIST procedures. METHODS: The database was queried using keywords: rezum, urolift, prostate embolization (PAE), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), prostate stent and Temporarily Implanted Nitinol Device (iTIND) on 10/1/22 to extract information regarding device problems and procedure-related complications. Gupta classification system was used to stratify complications. Statistical analysis was performed to compare frequency of complications among MIST procedures. RESULTS: We found a total of 692 reports (Rezum-358, urolift-226, PAE-53, TUNA-31, TUMT-19, prostatic stent-4, and iTIND-1). Most complications related to device or users were minor (level 1 and 2) and there was no significant difference among various MIST procedures. The screen/system error was responsible for 93% and 83% aborted cases in Rezum and TUNA, respectively, and PAE showed 40% of device component detachment/fracture. Overall Urolift and TUMT were associated with statistically significant higher incidence of major (level 3 and 4) complications (23% and 21%, respectively) as compared with Rezum (7%). Most major complications needing hospitalization after Urolift included hematoma and hematuria with clots and those after Rezum included urinary tract infection and sepsis. Thirteen deaths were reported, mostly due to cardiovascular events, which were classified as not associated with the proposed treatment. CONCLUSION: MIST for BPH can occasionally cause significant morbidity. Our data should assist urologists and patients in shared decision-making process.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review otology-related studies using the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to identify the opportunities and limitations of using MAUDE. DATABASES REVIEWED: PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EMBASE. METHODS: All studies reporting otology-related adverse events extracted from MAUDE were included from June 20, 2002, to 2022. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, selected articles for exclusion, extracted data, and appraised studies. Critical appraisal was done according to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for case series. RESULTS: The search yielded 5,645 studies, of which 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. All eight studies were case series; three evaluated cochlear implants, two evaluated osseointegrated hearing implants, and one evaluated illuminated operating microscope use. Quality assessment revealed all studies to be of poor quality. The most common domains contributing to these ratings included unclear study population, lack of consecutive participants, comparability of participants, clear and consistent outcome measures, and appropriate statistical analysis. CONCLUSION: Otology studies using the MAUDE database are of poor quality. This was primarily due to MAUDE's structural limitations as a passive surveillance system using nonstandardized free-text reports. The quality of studies also suffered from inappropriate analysis of MAUDE data, given its design. The utility of MAUDE could be improved by implementing case report best practices and converting the free fields to allow controlled and adaptive responses wherever possible to help standardize adverse event reporting.",

The process to obtain adverse events and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database that contains them are reviewed. METHODS: Tables were created in SQL Server for four CGM products (Dexcom G6, all versions of Abbott Libre, Medtronic Guardian 3, and Senseonics Eversense) containing either malfunction or injury adverse events sorted by the manufacturer's chosen product code. As the product code is not always clear (or appropriate), the causes of the events were determined from the text description of the adverse event. The resulting causes were listed in decreasing order in tables for each product and event type. RESULTS: A common effect of several event causes prevented the user from obtaining a result. Inaccuracy was also a frequent complaint. Other causes were specific to that device. CONCLUSIONS: Creating tables based on manufacturer problem codes for their CGMs, followed by analysis of the adverse event text, facilitates the analysis of event causes. Analyzing adverse event data is the first step in trying to reduce the number of adverse events.",

    "Title": "Analysis of Reported Adverse Events Related to Hemospray: An FDA MAUDE Database Study.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topical hemostatic powder is a mineral powder that forms an adherent barrier and coagulates active bleeding in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Hemospray is the first hemostatic powder approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. Hemospray has been increasingly used to manage GI bleeding. However, data on the adverse events of hemostatic powders are lacking. Therefore, we aim to report and analyze adverse events associated with Hemospray using the FDA's \"Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\" database. METHODS: We analyzed the postmarketing surveillance data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for Hemospray, initially known as TC-325, from June 2018 through April 2022. Results of the search were classified into device-related technical issues, patient-related adverse events and health care staff-related adverse events. RESULTS: Five hundred two medical device reporting claims were identified from June 2018 through April 2022. Seven duplicate claims were identified, and some claims included more than one event type. Therefore, there were 558 device-related problems, 28 patient-related adverse events, and 2 adverse events in health care staff members. The most common device-related problems were activation failure or failure to fire (n = 385, 70.0%) and obstruction of carbon dioxide flow (n = 121, 21.7). The most common patient-related adverse events included tissue injury or bleeding (n = 21) and perforation (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Although Hemospray is a valuable tool in the armamentarium for endoscopists in managing GI bleeding, endoscopists must be mindful of deice-related problems and potential patient-related adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted of the US Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database, to evaluate the complication profile of cochlear implantation according to manufacturer. METHODS: A review of the MAUDE database was conducted from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020. Complications, including infection, extrusion, facial nerve stimulation, meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid leak, were identified using key word searches. The categorised data were analysed using a chi-square test to determine a difference in global complication incidence between three major cochlear implant manufacturers: manufacturer A (Cochlear Limited), manufacturer B (Med-El) and manufacturer C (Advanced Bionics). RESULTS: A total of 31 857 adverse events were analysed. Implants of manufacturer C were associated with a statistically higher rate of infection (0.97 per cent), cerebrospinal fluid leak (0.07 per cent), extrusion (0.44 per cent) and facial nerve stimulation (0.11 per cent). Implants of manufacturer B were associated with a statistically higher rate of meningitis (0.07 per cent). CONCLUSION: Consideration of patient risk factors along with cochlear implant manufacturers can heighten awareness of cochlear implant complications pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively.",

    "Title": "Complications and device failures associated with urolift: Findings from the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urolift is an established intervention for symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction caused by benign prostate enlargement. Reported advantages include its minimally invasive profile, short learning curve and feasibility as a day case procedure. Our aim was to use a national registry as a means to evaluate the nature of complications and device failures that have been documented to occur. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of the US Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, a prospective register, which contains voluntarily submitted adverse events associated with surgical devices. Information collected include event timing, underlying cause, procedural completion, complications and mortality status. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2023, 103 device failures, 5 intra-operative complications and 165 post-operative complications (early: 151, late: 14) were registered. The commonest device problem (56%, n = 58) was failure of the implant to deploy with subsequent requirement for complete replacement. There were 50 cases of documented urosepsis. 62 patients with post operative haematuria were registered including 12 that underwent emergency embolisation. Other complications included stroke (n = 5), pulmonary embolism (n = 3) and necrotising fasciitis (n = 1). Twelve ITU admissions were registered. In the reports, 22 cases were filed that recorded a hospital stay of 7 days or more. Eleven deaths were captured in the database over the study period. CONCLUSION: While urolift is recognised as less invasive intervention compared to alternatives such as transurethral resection of the prostate, serious adverse events have been reported to occur including death. Our findings can provide learning points for surgeons and allow for improved patient counselling and treatment planning accordingly.",

    "Title": "Characteristic adverse events with intra-aortic balloon pumps: An analysis of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database from 2016 to 2021.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) dataset represents a unique source for post-market surveillance data on adverse events (AE). An analysis of AE with percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (pMCS) devices has previously been reported specifically for microaxial flow pumps. The characteristic AE for the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) have not been similarly analyzed or reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All events in the MAUDE dataset between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2021 were reviewed involving the Linear, Mega and Sensation devices (Datascope/Getinge, Wayne New Jersey). Data was analyzed by two authors and categorized based on AE type, date, event type and device-related or patient-related AE. RESULTS: A total of 2795 AE were reported over five years. Device malfunction (91.4 %) was the most frequent classification followed by death (5.6 %) and injury (3.0 %). Catheter deformation/fracture/leak accounted for 37.9 % of total AEs. The most common patient event categorization was asymptomatic (90.8 %). Vessel damage/hemorrhage occurred in 1.4 % of reports. Death occurred in 5.6 % of reports and was associated with cardiac arrest in 110 of 156 events. Thrombus formation was described in 1.1 % of AEs. Device optic AE were common and unique to Sensation catheters. Calibration errors were also more common with Sensation (4.6 % versus 1.3 %) compared to other models. CONCLUSIONS: Publicly reported AE with IABPs are predominantly device malfunctions without clinical sequelae. Injury, vascular damage, bleeding and thrombosis AEs are not frequent amongst reported AEs. Emphasis should be placed on understanding mechanisms of device malfunction in order to improve both reliability and user experience.",

    "Title": "Surgical Fires Involving Alcohol-Based Preparation Solution, 1991-2020.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-based skin preparations were first approved for surgical use in 1998 and have since become standard in most surgical fields. The purpose of this report is to examine incidence of surgical fires because of alcohol-based skin preparation and to understand how approval and regulation of alcohol-based skin preparations impacted trends in fires over time. METHODS: We identified all reported surgical fires resulting in patient or staff harm from 1991 through 2020 reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We examined incidence of fires because of these preparations, trends after approval and regulation, and common causes. RESULTS: We identified 674 reports of surgical fires resulting in harm to patients and surgical personnel, in which 84 involved an alcohol-based preparation. The time-adjusted model shows that from 1996 through 2006, there was a 26.4% increase in fires followed by a 9.7% decrease from 2007 to 2020. The decrease in fires was most rapid for head and neck and upper aerodigestive tract surgeries. Qualitative content analysis revealed improper surgical site preparation as well as close proximity of surgical sites to an oxygen source as the most common causes of fires. CONCLUSION: Since FDA approval, alcohol-based preparation solutions have been associated with a significant percentage of surgical fires. Warning label updates from 2006 to 2012 coupled with increased awareness efforts of associated risks of alcohol-based surgical solutions likely contributed to the decrease in fires. Improper surgical site preparation technique and close proximity of surgical sites to oxygen continue to be risk factors for fires. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 134:607-613, 2024.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events and Complications Associated With Vagal Nerve Stimulation: An Analysis of the Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) can have devastating consequences for patients and families. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) is used as a surgical adjunct for treating DRE not amenable to surgical resection. Although VNS is generally safe, it has its inherent complications. With the increasing number of implantations, adequate patient education with discussion of possible complications forms a critical aspect of informed consent and patient counseling. There is a lack of large-scale reviews of device malfunction, patient complaints, and surgically related complications available to date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complications associated with VNS implants performed between 2011 and 2021 were identified through a search of the United States Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data base. We found three models on the data base, CYBERONICS, INC pulse gen Demipulse 103, AspireSR 106, and SenTiva 1000. The reports were classified into three main groups, \"Device malfunction,\" \"Patient complaints,\" and \"Surgically managed complications.\" RESULTS: A total of 5888 complications were reported over the ten-year period, of which 501 reports were inconclusive, 610 were unrelated, and 449 were deaths. In summary, there were 2272 reports for VNS 103, 1526 reports for VNS 106, and 530 reports for VNS 1000. Within VNS 103, 33% of reports were related to device malfunction, 33% to patient complaints, and 34% to surgically managed complications. For VNS 106, 35% were related to device malfunction, 24% to patient complaints, and 41% to surgically managed complications. Lastly, for VNS 1000, 8% were device malfunction, 45% patient complaints, and 47% surgically managed complications. CONCLUSION: We present an analysis of the MAUDE data base for adverse events and complications related to VNS. It is hoped that this description of complications and literature review will help promote further improvement in its safety profile, patient education, and management of both patient and clinician expectations.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review and summarize reported adverse events related to the use of porcine small intestine submucosal grafts (Biodesign™) in otologic procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for all medical device reports (MDR) related to otologic use of Biodesign™ (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) from January 2016 to November 2022. Adverse events (AEs) were identified by reviewing all reports with the basic search term \"Biodesign\" and \"Biodesign, Otologic\". Reports were individually reviewed and categorized with special attention to AEs. RESULTS: A total of 500 reports were reviewed. Since FDA approval of Biodesign™ in 2016, there have been 5 adverse events reported for use of Biodesign™ during otologic surgery (tympanoplasty, n = 3; stapes surgery, n = 2). All reported events described patient injury, and all cases required at least one revision surgery. Four cases described significant foreign body inflammatory reactions. Complications included hearing loss (n = 3), severe otalgia (n = 2), persistent perforation (n = 2), vertigo (n = 2), and facial paralysis (n = 1). CONCLUSION: The use of porcine small intestinal submucosal graft has been thought to be a safe and effective option for otologic surgery, with the advantage of availability without graft harvest in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. However, foreign body or granulomatous reactions have been documented and should be considered prior to its use in otologic surgery.",

We studied medical device-related reports of leiomyoma RFA devices to determine whether there are emerging device-related issues. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried from 2012 through November 2022. Sixty unique reports, including adverse events and device malfunctions, were analyzed for both laparoscopic and transcervical RFA devices. Forty-three injury reports were reviewed. The most common adverse event was infection. Of the injury cases, 34.9% required additional surgical intervention. Although the details of each event are limited, these reports highlight the importance of postmarket surveillance of new technologies and the necessity of improving the current system of implementation and monitoring.",

    "Title": "Airway fires in otolaryngologic surgery: A database review.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: An estimated 34 % of reported operating room fires involve the airway. Despite the inherent risks in otolaryngologic surgery, education regarding prevention and management of airway fires is limited in graduate medical training. One contributing factor is a lack of reporting of such rare events in our literature. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of adverse events related to fires occurring during surgical procedures of the airway from January 1, 2010, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: 3687 reports were identified and 49 unique reports of airway fire were included. Sustained fires were described in 16 (32.7 %) reports and 33 (67.3 %) described transient flares. 2 fires extended beyond the airway and 9 (18.4 %) were noted to have occurred at the start of the case. Fires were reported most commonly during tonsillectomy (n = 22 [44.9 %]), vocal fold excision (n = 5 [10.2 %]), and adenoidectomy (n = 4 [8.2 %]). 46 reports attributed flare initiation to a specific element of the fire triangle. 16 patient and 2 operator injuries were reported. Saline washing was utilized in 7 (14.3 %) cases overall. Patients were extubated immediately in 2 (12.5 %) of the 16 reports of sustained fires. 0 mortalities were reported. CONCLUSION: Airway fires were reported in a variety of upper airway procedures performed regularly by otolaryngologists. The triggering factor that led to fire was identified as a spark or char in about half of the reported cases, and only 2 reports described immediate removal of the endotracheal tube.",

    "Title": "Coronary Intra-orbital Atherectomy Complications and Procedural Failure: Insight From the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Diamondback 360® Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System (Cardiovascular Systems Inc., St. Paul, MN) is the first and only orbital atherectomy system approved by the US FDA for the treatment of severely calcified lesions. While the device has proven to be safe in clinical trials, real-world data are minimal. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports on the Diamondback 360® Coronary from January 2019 to January 2022. RESULTS: A total of 566 events were reported during the study period. After the exclusion of duplicate reports, the final cohort included 547 reports. The most common mode of failure was break or separation of a device part (40.4%, n = 221) mainly due to breaking in the tip of the ViperWire (66.1%), driveshaft (22.7%), or crown (12.2%). The most common vessel associated with events was the left anterior descending artery (31.4%), followed by the right coronary artery (26.9%), left circumflex (21.6%), and left main coronary artery (6.4%). The most common clinical adverse outcome was perforation (33.0%, n = 181) with 23.7% resulting in cardiac tamponade. Most perforation cases were treated by covered stent (44.2%), surgery (30.5%), stent (98%), and balloon angioplasty (9%). There were 89 (16.3%) events of death with 67% due to perforation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study provided a glimpse of real-world adverse outcomes and common modes of failure due to orbital atherectomy. The most common mode of failure was the break or separation of a device part and the most common complication was perforation according to the MAUDE database. It will help physicians to anticipate complications and escalate care appropriately.",

    "Title": "Understanding a decade of safety reporting for sacral neuromodulation in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Over 350 000 sacral neuromodulation (SNM) devices have been implanted since approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. SNM technology and clinical applications have evolved, with minimal safety updates after initial trials. We aim to provide an updated overview of real-world SNM safety. These insights will guide informed consent, preoperative counseling, and patient expectation-setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is a repository for medical device safety reports. We performed MAUDE categorical (1/1/98-12/31/10) and keyword (1/1/11-9/30/21) searches for \"Interstim.\" A random sample of 1000 reports was reviewed and categorized by theme. To corroborate our MAUDE database analysis, a legal librarian searched the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) database, as well as Bloomberg Law's dockets database for all lawsuits related to SNM devices. RESULTS: Our search of the MAUDE database returned 44 122 SNM-related adverse events (AEs). The figure illustrates the prevalence of event categories in the random sample. The largest proportion of reports (25.6%) related to a patient's need for assistance with device use, followed by loss/change of efficacy (19.0%). Interestingly, a fall preceded issue onset in 32% of non-shock pain, 30% of lead/device migration, and 27% of painful shock reports. Our legal search revealed only four lawsuits: one for patient complications after an SNM device was used off-label, one case of transverse myelitis after implant, one for device migration or poor placement, and the fourth claimed the device malfunctioned requiring removal and causing permanent injury. CONCLUSIONS: This review confirms the real-world safety of SNM devices and very low complication rates as seen in the original clinical trials. Our findings indicate that 43.2% (95% confidence interval 40.1%-46.3%) of SNM \"complications\" are not AEs, per se, but rather reflect a need for improved technical support or more comprehensive informed consent to convey known device limitations to the patient, such as battery life. Similarly, the number of lawsuits is shockingly low for a device that has been in the market for 24 years, reinforcing the safety of the device. Legal cases involving SNM devices seem to relate to inappropriate patient selection-including at least one case in which SNM was used for a non-FDA approved indication-lack of appropriate follow-up, and/or provider inability to assist the patient with utilizing the device after implantation.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Related to Direct-To-Consumer Sequential Aligners-A Study of the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "Background-Direct-to-consumer (DTC) sequential aligners promote \"teeth straightening\" at a low cost and with added patient convenience. DTC sequential aligners have risen in popularity among the general public and sparked debate among dental professionals. Dental professionals argue that using these aligners without an in-person diagnosis and treatment planning protocol set by a licensed dentist or orthodontist may lead to adverse effects on teeth and surrounding structures. The objective of this study is to describe adverse clinical events associated with the use of DTC sequential aligners as reported in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (FDA MAUDE) database. Methods-We searched the MAUDE database from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020 for the product code of 'NXC' (sequential aligners). The year, type of adverse event, reporter occupation, and event description were noted. Results-651 reports associated with sequential aligners were found, of which 104 were related to DTC sequential aligners. Fifty-four adverse events were reported in 2019. From the event description, 41.3% comprised bite problems, 29.8% comprised orofacial pain, and 26.6% of patients had some form of periodontal sequelae. Furthermore, 69.2% of the patients followed up after an adverse event with a dentist not associated with DTC aligners. Conclusions-The use of DTC sequential aligners without dental supervision has led to oral health problems, as documented in the MAUDE database. Commonly reported adverse events include bite problems, pain, sensitivity, and periodontal disease, and some adverse events are irreversible.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: There have been numerous cases of adverse events since the introduction of Essure medical devices for sterilization in 2002. This study analyzed the safety event reports of the Essure reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). METHODS: A retrospective analysis examined the MAUDE reports between Jan-1, 2018, and Oct-31, 2018 and focused on safety reports related to the Essure device. Safety reports were categorized and analyzed by their event type, device problem, patients' symptoms and the level of harm. Of this study cohort, 10% of samples were randomly selected for quantitative analyses. Thematic analysis was conducted for reports included death cases. RESULTS: A total of 4,994 eligible reports were analyzed. There were ten reports associated with individuals' deaths, and the main themes of safety reports from qualitative analysis were pains, bleeding, surgery, migraine, and infection. Quantitative analysis of 500 randomly selected samples showed that 98% of adverse event reports were associated with different injuries such as surgery, pain, bleeding, hysterectomy, and menorrhagia. Additionally, more than 90% of reports were submitted by the manufacturer. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated several safety issues of Essure. More meaningful pre- and post-marketing surveillance and regulation are warranted in the medical device market to ensure safety and effectiveness, including investigating complaints, promptly sharing relevant information with regulators and users, and implementing corrective actions.",

    "Title": "Carotid artery dissections from transcarotid artery revascularization as reported by the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is a hybrid procedure that allows reversal of blood flow away from the brain while placing a stent through direct surgical access of the common carotid artery. It has been shown to have a lower risk of perioperative stroke compared with any prospective trial of transfemoral carotid artery stenting. However, intraoperative injuries related to the procedure and its management are not well characterized. One of the intraoperative complications seen in TCAR is iatrogenic carotid artery dissection (CD). We aim to add qualitative insight in further characterizing CDs and its management in this emerging technology. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for surveillance of all medical devices approved for use. This database was queried for all cases associated with Silk Road Medical's ENROUTE Transcarotid Neuroprotection System from September 2016 to October 2020. Case narratives related to CD were individually analyzed to determine time of injury (intraoperative, recovery, and post-discharge follow-up). CD reporting was further analyzed for the associated procedural event at the time of injury, number of access attempts to CD repair, and type of CD repair. Reports associated with CD repair were further categorized into endovascular repair and open surgical repair. RESULTS: Of the 115 unique adverse events in the database, there were 58 CDs. Most were identified intraoperatively (n = 55), while three were incidentally found postoperatively. Overall, sheath placement was the most common procedural event attributed to CD (N = 34). There was adequate narrative information about CD repair in 54 patients. Intraoperative repair was performed in 52 cases and two were repaired after post-discharge follow-up imaging was performed.Among CDs that did not require additional access to engage the true lumen, the proportion of endovascular repair (62.5%) was significantly higher (p = .044) compared to the proportion of open surgical repair (37.5%). However, the proportion of open surgical repair (75%) was significantly higher than the proportion of endovascular repair (25%) in CDs with persistent failure to engage the true lumen despite ≥2 access attempts (p = .039). CONCLUSION: CD is the most common injury related to TCAR as reported on MAUDE. The most commonly reported procedural event associated with CD was sheath placement. The rate of intraoperative endovascular and open surgical CD repair was associated with whether the access to the true lumen of the carotid artery required additional access attempts or not. This should add qualitative insight among the vascular surgery community regarding intraoperative management of CDs from a TCAR procedure.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) prevents sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) but does not pace for post-shock asystole (PS-A) or bradycardia (PS-B;<50 beats/ min). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess PS-A and PS-B in patients dying out of hospital (OOH) while wearing a WCD. METHODS: The database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) was queried for manufacturers' reports of OOH deaths while patients were wearing a WCD. Excluded were patients who did not receive a shock or were initially shocked for asystole or during resuscitation. RESULTS: From January 2017 to March 2022, 313 patients received an initial WCD shock for VF (n = 150), VT (n = 90), and non-VF/VT rhythms (n = 73). PS-A occurred in 204 patients (65.2%), and PS-B occurred in 111 (35.5%); 85 (41.7%) PS-A patients also had PS-B. Most PS-A patients (n = 185; 90.7%) had an initial shocked rhythm of VF or VT, but 19 patients (9.3%) were initially inappropriately shocked for atrial fibrillation/supraventricular tachycardia (n = 7) and idioventricular (n = 8) or sinus (n = 4) rhythm. PS-A occurred after the first WCD shock in 118 (63.8%) and after the first, second, or third shocks in 159 patients (85.9%). Seven patients had post-shock heart block. Eight patients had permanent pacemakers; 1 became nonfunctional after 1 shock, and 7 showed noncapture and/or asystole after 1 to 4 shocks. CONCLUSIONS: Post-shock asystole appears to be common in patients who die OOH after being shocked by a WCD for VF or VT. PS-A also occurs after inappropriate WCD shocks for non-VF/VT rhythms. Implanted pacemakers may not prevent PS-A after a WCD shock. WCD backup pacing should be explored.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Eustachian tube balloon dilation is a minimally invasive technique used to improve persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction. Currently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of balloon dilation devices produced by three manufacturers, but little is known about associated adverse events and subsequent management. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Reports submitted to the FDA using the MAUDE database searched from January 2000 to July 2022 were analyzed for adverse events and management. RESULTS: A total of 13 adverse events were found in the database. Subcutaneous emphysema (n = 8) was the most common event. Other less frequent events included patulous Eustachian tube (n = 2), vascular dissection (n = 1), nasopharyngeal mucocele (n = 1), and tinnitus (n = 1). A majority of patients who experienced subcutaneous emphysema received antibiotics (n = 5) and were admitted to the hospital (n = 4). The patient with a carotid dissection 7 days postprocedure presented with a stroke and fully recovered after stent placement. There was limited preprocedure information in the MAUDE database. There were 2 patients who did not fully recover after a complication. Three patients underwent corrective surgical interventions. No one company had more associated adverse events reported. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous emphysema is the most common adverse event after Eustachian tube dilation. Further studies exploring potential balloon dilation adverse events to allow for better patient counseling are warranted.",

    "Title": "Lessons Learned from the MAUDE Database on Transvaginal Synthetic Mesh and Sling Reports.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We investigated the volume and sources of MDRs (medical device reports) on transvaginal mesh and sling complications in the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed reports on transvaginal mesh and sling complications submitted to the MAUDE database from 2008 to 2014. We also examined reports for major mesh and sling brands as well as reporter occupation. RESULTS: The number of reports on transvaginal mesh and sling implants increased slowly from 2008 to 2011, ending with 1,687 reports in 2011. In 2012 the volume increased nearly sevenfold, yielding 11,710 reports. The year 2013 witnessed an even greater surge, with a total of 43,680 complication reports. This trend quickly subsided in 2014 as the number of reports decreased to 5,467. Meanwhile, the number of attorney submitted reports greatly increased by a factor of 18.6 in 2012 and then by a smaller increment in 2013. Physician submitted reports increased threefold in 2012 and then by a factor of 5.6 in 2013. Unfortunately more than half of the 2013 reports list an unknown occupation for the reporter. CONCLUSIONS: The marked growth of transvaginal mesh and sling reports in the MAUDE database, as well as attorney submitted reports, correlated with the timing of the 2011 FDA issued notification warning the public about the risk of complications associated with transvaginal mesh placement. Despite some shortcomings, the MAUDE database offers an appropriate tool to measure overall trends of device complications and serves as a vehicle for the FDA to alert the public regarding potential dangers.",

    "Title": "Epidemiology of Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma in the United States: A Systematic Review.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although textured implants represent fewer than 10% of implants used in the United States, the country reports the highest incidence of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic literature review on US-based epidemiology to update knowledge on BIA-ALCL in the United States. METHODS: Publications on US BIA-ALCL epidemiology were searched between September 2022 and March 2023 on MEDLINE (National Institutes of Health; Bethesda, MD), Embase (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Web of Science (Clarivate, London, UK), and SCOPUS (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The US numerator was obtained by averaging the FDA MAUDE database and the PSF PROFILE registry, while the denominator was estimated from chest X-rays, and included female transgender individuals. Prevalence and risk were assessed accordingly, but the incidence rate (IR) could not be updated due to the lack of available follow-up data. RESULTS: Out of 987 identified manuscripts, 10 were included. The US prevalence of BIA-ALCL in the literature ranged from 1:300 to 1:500,000 and the IR from 4.5 per 10,000 to 31.1 per 100 million persons per year. A mean value of 453.5 BIA-ALCL cases was calculated. From a denominator of 4,264,618 individuals, which includes all breast implant surfaces, we calculated 414,521 individuals with textured implants, indicating a textured prevalence of 109.4 cases per 100,000 individuals and a risk of 1:913. CONCLUSIONS: BIA-ALCL IR, prevalence, and risk has increased when calculated exclusively for patients with textured devices. Although US macrotextured implants were recalled by the FDA, these findings may influence the surveillance of existing patients and the use of macrotextured implants in other parts of the world where they remain widespread.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tracheotomy is one of the most common procedures. Although tracheostomy complications have been extensively studied, literature related to device complications is scarce. The objective of this study is to describe complications associated with tracheostomies utilizing the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MAUDE database (2015-2020). METHODS: The FDA's MAUDE database was queried for all reports on adverse events related to tracheostomy from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3086 adverse events related to open tracheostomy and 52 related to percutaneous tracheostomy were identified. For open tracheostomy, 2872 (93%), were related to device malfunction, and 214 (7%) consisted of patient-related factors. The most frequently reported device-related adverse event was cuff malfunction, with 1834 (59%) reported events, which includes cuff deflation, pilot balloon malfunction, and cuff inflation line malfunction. The most frequently reported patient-related adverse events were tracheostomy tube obstruction with 67 events (2%). For percutaneous tracheostomy, 38 (73%) events were related to device malfunction, and 14 (27%) were related to patient injury. The most frequently reported adverse events were cuff malfunction (29%), safety ridge malfunction (17%), and bleeding (10%). CONCLUSION: The MAUDE database is a useful tool that can be utilized to complement existing literature in identifying common and rare adverse events associated with tracheostomy device-related failures, which are mostly reliant on isolated, published case reports.",

    "Title": "Eustachian Tube Balloon Dilation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Adverse Events.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) has been Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction since 2016. While ETBD is generally seen as safe, the complication profile has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to utilize the FDA manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database to better assess adverse events (AE) related to ETBD. METHODS: This is a study of a multiinstitutional database maintained by the U.S. FDA. A database analysis was performed via the collaboration of multiple clinicians at tertiary referral centers. The FDA MAUDE database was queried for all medical device reports (MDR) related to ETBD devices from January 2012 to November 2022. Eighty-eight unique MDR were identified, 16 of which met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Three MDRs were classified as device-related (18.8%); none resulted in an AE. Thirteen MDRs (81.3%) were patient-related; all were classified as AEs. The most common AE was postoperative subcutaneous emphysema (n = 6, 46.2%). Of the patients with subcutaneous emphysema, there was a wide range of severity. The most severe AE (n = 1, 6.3%) was postoperative stroke secondary to carotid artery dissection. CONCLUSION: Though ETBD is generally seen as a safe procedure, there have been several concerning AEs reported to date. Increased awareness of ETBD complications can serve as a primer for improved patient education and counseling during the informed consent process and aid surgeons in clinical decision-making. Future studies with standardized reporting protocols are warranted to create a central registry for ETBD.",

    "Abstract": "Background and objective Aspiration thrombectomy devices, such as the AngioJet Solent Omni (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA) have been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of thrombi in peripheral arterial disease, venous disease, and AV fistulas. However, there is a dearth of real-world data on the most common modes of failure and complications associated with the AngioJet Solent Omni. In this study, we aimed to address this scarcity of data. Methods The MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database was queried for reports of device failure and adverse events spanning the period from October 2012 to December 2021. Results A total of 499 events were reported during the study period. After the exclusion of duplicate reports, the final analysis included 450 reports. The most common mode of failure was catheter breakage/kinking during suction thrombectomy with 137 reports (30%). The most common vessel associated with events was the superficial femoral artery or vein, which was documented in 82 reports (18.2%). The most common adverse clinical outcome was the embedding of a piece of the device in the patient, which occurred in seven reports (1.6%). There were seven (1.6%) events of death reported during the period studied. Conclusions Based on our findings, theAngioJet Solent Omni device provides promising results; however, it is important to evaluate device safety. It is associated with complications including device embedment, catheter breakage/kinking, and death, and these adverse events are linked to patient characteristics and risk factors.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dual occlusive closure mechanism (disc and lobe type), Amulet device (Abbott; a second-generation device that has replaced Amplatzer Cardiac Plug) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2021 for percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO). However, real-world safety data on the delivery system (Amplatzer Cardiac Plug and Amplatzer Amulet device) are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the type of adverse events associated with the Amplatzer LAAO delivery system using the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A MAUDE database search was conducted on March 31, 2023, for reports received between February 2013 and March 2023 to capture all adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 59 adverse events were reported, of which 58 were sheath-related events, and one was a wire-related event. The most commonly encountered issue was air embolism (19%, 11 events), followed by sheath thrombosis (13.8%, eight events, two of which were also associated with device thrombosis), kinked sheath (10.3%, six events), and sheath deformation (8.6%, five events). Patient-related adverse events included pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis (22.4%, 13 events), vascular complications (20.7%, 12 events), and device dislodgement (5.2%, three events). CONCLUSION: LAAO-related adverse events are increasingly being reported using the Amplatzer LAAO delivery sheath. It is anticipated that improvements in device technology, the advent of steerable sheaths, and operator experience will minimize these complications.",

    "Title": "Investigating the Complications and Causes of Failure of the AngioVac System: A Post-Marketing Surveillance From the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "Background Aspiration thrombectomy devices, such as the AngioVac, allow the removal of thrombus, especially in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation use. The AngioVac was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to remove fresh, soft thrombi or emboli during extracorporeal bypass for up to six hours. Real-world data on the most common modes of failure and complications associated with the AngioVac are unavailable. Methods The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for reports of the AngioVac device failure and adverse events from April 2013 to March 2022. Categorical variables were described as numbers, and all statistical calculations were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results A total of 115 events were reported during the study period. After the exclusion of duplicate reports, the final cohort included 93 reports. The most common mode of failure for the AngioVac was physical damage of the device, with 13 reports (14%). The most common vessels associated with events were the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava, occurring in 23 reports (24.7%). The most common adverse clinical events were pulmonary embolism (PE), occurring in 33 reports (35.5%), and perforation, occurring in 16 reports (17.2%). Other less frequent adverse outcomes were arrhythmias, stroke, and foreign body device embedment. There were 45 deaths reported with the use of the AngioVac. Conclusions Aspiration thrombectomy devices provide promising efficacy; however, physicians should be aware of known adverse outcomes, even if they are infrequent. Based on this analysis, PE and vessel perforation were the most common adverse outcomes. Furthermore, the most common mode of failure was secondary to physical damage of the device.",

    "Title": "Adverse Event Reporting of Commonly Used Gender-Specific Implantable Medical Devices in the United States.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that more women are harmed by implantable medical devices than men. It is unknown whether this difference includes gender-specific devices. METHODS: In this study, we examine the differences in reported adverse events between 6 female- and 5 male-specific implantable devices from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 1993 to 2018. Primary endpoints were injury type (life-threatening, disability, death) and the rate of device evaluation by the manufacturer. Proportions of valid entries across these variables were compared using either the Fisher exact test or χ2 test. RESULTS: Female-specific devices had higher rates of life-threatening outcomes (1.6% versus 0.3%, P < 0.001), disabilities (5.0% versus 4.3%, P < 0.001), and deaths (0.6% versus 0.1%, P < 0.001) compared with the male-specific devices. Of the 8159 devices that were evaluated by the manufacturer, 56% were female specific while 44% were male specific. Female-specific devices were evaluated far less frequently by the manufacturer (4.5% versus 38.2%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased adverse events reports for female-specific devices and associated high-grade complications necessitates improved postmarket surveillance.",

    "Title": "Respiratory Sensing Lead Malfunction in Upper Airway Stimulation: A Single Institution Report.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is an effective treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The device consists of a stimulating electrode, an internal pulse generator, and a respiratory sensing lead. The purpose of this study is to characterize the incidence of sensing lead malfunction necessitating revision surgery in a high-volume center in conjunction with a review of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database reports on adverse events associated with the sensing lead component. METHODS: Patients age ≥18 implanted with the device were reviewed between July 2017 and June 2022. Those determined to have sensing lead malfunction were analyzed. The FDA MAUDE database was reviewed for reports associated with \"Inspire Model 4323 Respiratory\" and \"Inspire Model 4340 Respiratory\" between January 2014 and September 2022. RESULTS: One hundred ninety patients underwent UAS at our institution during the study period and four (2.1%) patients were found to have sensing lead malfunction. Analysis of the MAUDE database revealed 122 reports of adverse events associated with the sensing lead component, with 72% (88/122) of these requiring revision surgery. The most frequently reported adverse event was sensing lead tip separation from lead body, noted in 46% of these reports (56/122). CONCLUSION: The functionality of the sensing lead component is vital to the integrity of the UAS device and is measurable through waveform analysis. To provide optimal care after device implantation, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the scenarios in which this component fails, the incidence of such events, and appropriate management.

    "Abstract": "With the widespread adoption of intranasal radiofrequency (RF) devices, our objective was to report national adverse events (AEs) associated with their use. The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience was queried. A total of 24 device-related AEs were reported, 11 (45.8%) for Celon® (Olympus), 3 (12.5%) for Vivaer® (Aerin), 2 (8.3%) for Neuromark® (Neurent), and 8 (33.3%) for Rhinaer® (Aerin). Seven (63.6%) of the Celon®-related complications were related to tissue necrosis (largely user error-related), but 1 (9.1%) episode of pediatric ocular palsy was also reported. Vivaer® complications included synechiae formation, a mucosal perforation, and a case of empty nose syndrome. Of the posterior nasal nerve ablating devices, 9 of 10 AEs were epistaxes, of which 7 (77.8%) required operative intervention. Surgeons should exercise vigilance and tissue-appropriate device settings when utilizing RF devices. Epistaxis and tissue necrosis may occur, as well as more rare, but devastating, complications.",

    "Title": "Insights From the FDA's MAUDE Database Regarding the Real-World Safety of Jetstream Atherectomy for Peripheral Arterial Disease.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rotational atherectomy has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, published data regarding the safety of these devices are limited. The Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database collects reports of adverse event for medical devices. We present 3 years of MAUDE adverse events data for the Jetstream Atherectomy System (Boston Scientific) for the treatment of PAD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MAUDE from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Duplicate reports and those with insufficient information were excluded, leaving a total of 500 reports for analysis. Adverse events were categorized as either patient complication, device malfunction, or both. Adverse events were classified using the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe's (CIRSE) classification system for adverse events. RESULTS: The most common patient complications were embolism (22; 4.4%), dissection (17; 3.4%), vessel perforation (12; 2.4%), and device fracture in the patient (6; 1.2%). The most common modes of device failure were entrapment of the device on the guidewire (134; 27%), loss of blade rotation (116; 23%), loss of aspiration (99; 20%), and mechanical damage (57; 11%). As per the CIRSE adverse events classification, most events had no post-procedural sequelae (475; 95%), followed by those requiring prolonged observation (14; 2.8%), and post-procedural therapy without long-term sequelae (10; 2.0%). One hundred six devices (21%) were returned for manufacturer analysis. CONCLUSION: We highlight important adverse events encountered in real-world practice with the Jetstream Atherectomy System. This analysis provides further understanding of the safety profile and modes of failure of Jetstream, and could help guide improvements in product design and manufacturer-user training. There is greater need for root-cause analysis that can aided by returning devices to the manufacturer. CLINICAL IMPACT: We highlight important adverse events encountered in real-world practice with the Jetstream Atherectomy System. The MAUDE database is useful for capturing and characterizing modes of device failure/malfunction not typically described in conventional clinical studies. This may provide valuable information to help guide improvements in product design and manufacturer-user training. This information could also potentially be useful in helping establish manufacturer and product liability in the setting of medicolegal claims. We hope that by contributing to the growing understanding of the safety profile of the Jetstream Atherectomy System, our study may help physicians and patients come to more informed decisions regarding treatment options for PAD.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize adverse events related to use of the perirectal spacing agent SpaceOAR, we examined the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for \"SpaceOAR\" and \"Augmenix\" from June 2015 (when SpaceOAR was approved by the Food and Drug Administration) to October 2022. Reports were reviewed for adverse events (AEs), operative procedures performed because of the AE, and changes to the radiation plan. AEs were categorized using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. RESULTS: Six hundred fifty-four reports were reviewed. Eighty-four were excluded and 4 reports reviewed 2 separate cases of SpaceOAR administration. Five hundred seventy-four cases were ultimately included. Three deaths were reported (0.5% of all AEs). One point six percent of cases represented CTCAE grade 4 injuries (life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated), 15.9% grade 3 (severe but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization), 24.2% grade 2 (moderate; local/noninvasive intervention), and 57% of events were CTCAE grade 1 (mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms). Bowel diversion occurred in 29 cases (9%). CONCLUSION: Both asymptomatic (n = 311) and debilitating (n = 12) complications of SpaceOAR hydrogel use were identified. Death, gel embolization, anaphylaxis, rectal ulcerations, and infections requiring bowel or urinary diversions were among the complications reviewed. Providers should consider these potential complications before perirectal spacer administration and during patient counseling.",

OBJECTIVE: To report and describe the adverse events related to the use of Artic Front cryoballoon catheters (Arctic Front, Arctic Front Advance, and Arctic Front Advance Pro) reported in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturers and User Defined Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: We reviewed all the adverse events reported to the FDA MAUDE database over a 10.7-year study period from January 01, 2011 to September 31, 2021. All events were independently reviewed by two physicians. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 320 procedural-related adverse events reported in the MAUDE database were identified. The most common adverse event was transient or persistent phrenic nerve palsy (PNP), accounting for 48% of all events. This was followed by cardiac perforation (15%), pulmonary vein stenosis (8%), transient ischemic attack or stroke (6%), vascular injury (4%), transient or persistent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (3%), hemoptysis (2%), pericarditis (2%), and esophageal ulcer or fistula (1%). There were six reported intra-procedural death events as a result of cardiac perforation. CONCLUSION: The two most common procedural adverse events associated with cryoballoon ablation were PNP and cardiac perforation. All cases of procedural mortality were due to cardiac perforation.",

    "Title": "Nasal Epistaxis Balloons: A Comprehensive MAUDE Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: While nasal epistaxis balloons are generally seen as safe and routinely utilized by both surgical and nonsurgical providers, the complication profile related to this type of device has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to utilize the FDA MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database to better assess adverse events (AE) related to use of nasal epistaxis balloons. Reports were individually tabulated and events were categorized with special attention to AEs. METHODS: The FDA MAUDE database was queried for all medical device reports (MDR) related to nasal epistaxis balloon devices from January 2012 to November 2022. RESULTS: 19 MDRs met inclusion criteria. 5 MDRs were classified as device related (26.3 %); two events were reported for balloon leak and deflation, two events were reported for device breakage, and one device related event was unknown. 14 MDRs (73.7 %) were classified as patient related. Two documented MDRs were patient deaths due to exsanguination. Additional serious AEs included balloon ingestion and subsequent small bowel perforation (n = 1), cerebrospinal fluid leak (n = 1), skull base violation and intracranial placement of the device (n = 1), and respiratory distress (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Though epistaxis control with nasal balloons is generally seen as a safe procedure, there have been several concerning AEs reported. While two reports of death due to exsanguination were the most severe AEs, multiple other life-threatening AEs were also documented. Increased awareness of associated complications can be used to better counsel patients during the informed consent process as well as providers in their clinical decision making.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The microdebrider is a powered surgical instrument that is widely used in the field of otolaryngology. We aim to identify the type and frequency of device malfunctions, patient complications, and subsequent interventions related to the use of microdebriders. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2011 to 2021 Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of \"microdebrider,\" with adverse events selected that pertained to usage in head and neck surgeries from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2021. RESULTS: There were 282 adverse events in 267 individual medical device reports (MDR). Although the majority of the reports did not specify the specific operation, endoscopic sinus surgery was the most common reported procedure (89, 33.3%). The most common cause of device malfunction was due to a broken piece (120, 48.2%) followed by overheating of the microdebrider motor (78, 31.3%). Of the reports which specified patient injury, the most commonly reported was \"unintentional tissue damage,\" (10, 32.3%). CONCLUSION: The microdebrider has demonstrated utility within the field of otolaryngology, but is not without risk of malfunction that can cause patient injury. By understanding possible risks of microdebrider usage, including tissue damage, burns, and bleeds caused by device malfunction or operator error, physicians can be better prepared to address complications and educate patients.",

    "Title": "Characterizing complications associated with skull clamps: A review of the manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Head immobilization with skull clamps is a prerequisite of many neurosurgical procedures. Adverse events relating to the use of skull clamps have been reported, however, given the paucity of published reports, we sought to conduct a more comprehensive analysis using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for neurosurgical skull clamp events over a 10-year period between January 2013 and December 2022. Reports were qualitatively analyzed and categorically assigned by the study authors as 'mechanical failure,' 'slippage,' 'contamination,' 'insufficient information,' and 'other.' Patient injury reports were also classified as 'abrasion,' 'laceration,' 'hematoma,' 'fracture,' 'intracranial hemorrhage (ICH),' 'other,' 'insufficient information,' and 'death.' RESULTS: Of 3672 reports retrieved, 2689 (73.2%) were device malfunctions, with mechanical failure (50.7%) and slippage (47.7%) being the most common causes. There were 983 reports (26.8%) involving patient injury which included lacerations (n = 776, 78.9%), fractures (n = 24, 2.4%), abrasions (n = 23, 2.3%), hematomas (n = 7, 0.71%), ICH (n = 3, 0.31%), and other causes (n = 6, 0.61%). Five (0.1%) deaths due to skull clamp related complications were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a more comprehensive picture of adverse events in neurosurgical procedures relating to the use of skull clamps. Mechanical failures of device parts were the most common device-related complication, and lacerations the most common adverse patient-related event. While more severe patient-related events were reported, they are relatively rare. The MAUDE database is useful for characterizing underreported device-related and patient-related adverse events.",

An initial literature review on Spontaneous Reporting System databases, Health Information Technologies (HIT) fault classification, and Natural Language Processing has been conducted, from which it clearly emerges that adverse events related to HIT are increasing over time. The proposed framework uses NLP techniques and Explainable Artificial Intelligence models to automatically identify HIT-related adverse event reports. The designed model employs a pre-trained version of ClinicalBERT that has been fine-tuned and tested on 3,075 adverse event reports extracted from the FDA MAUDE database and manually labelled by experts.",

    "Title": "Failure to defibrillate or cardiovert due to premature truncation of biphasic shocks from implantable defibrillators.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2022 and 2023, Medtronic recalled implantable defibrillators because they may deliver less than full-energy shocks. The 2022 problem truncates the second phase of the waveform (SCP-T2), resulting in ∼32-J shocks, and is mitigated by downloadable software. The 2023 malfunction truncates the first phase of the waveform, resulting in 0- to 12-J shocks due to a glassed feedthrough problem (GFT-T1) that might be avoided by programming B>AX shock polarity. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the consequences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 shocks in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and to estimate the incidences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2. METHODS: We analyzed MAUDE reports supplemented by Medtronic data; lead failures were excluded. The incidences of SCP-T2 and GFT-T1 were estimated using USA volumes for devices with glassed feedthroughs. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two devices delivered truncated shocks: 27 (20.5%) were GFT-T1; 103 (78.0%) were SCP-T2; and 2 (1.5%) truncated both phases (BOTH-T1&2). Of 54 ventricular fibrillation (VF) patients, 21 (38.9%) were not defibrillated by truncated shocks: 8 (38.1%) received GFT-T1 shocks, 12 (57.1%) received SCP-T2 shocks, and 1 received a BOTH-T1&2 shock; 2 patients suffered unrelated deaths; 1 was externally rescued; 1 outcome was unknown; the others were defibrillated by subsequent shocks or terminated spontaneously. The majority of patients (79.1%) shocked for ventricular tachycardia (VT) were converted, primarily (94.1%) by SCP-T2 shocks. Estimated incidences of GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 were 0.0078%-0.0088% and 0.1062%-0.1110%. CONCLUSION: GFT-T1 and SCP-T2 shocks can result in failure to terminate VF/VT, but they may be preventable. Although the incidences of these truncated shocks are very low, heightened surveillance is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The safety of endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue acquisition through fine-needle biopsy devices is well-established in clinical trials. The real-world experience of using these devices is not known. The authors analyzed the postmarketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to answer this question. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database from January 2012 to June 2022 was accessed to evaluate for device malfunctions and patient-related adverse consequences of these malfunctions. RESULTS: There were 344 device-related issues. Most issues were due to detachment or breakage of the device (n = 185 [53.7%]). Seventy-six of the breakages (40.8%) occurred during the procedure, whereas 89 cases (47.8%) occurred while removing the needle from the endoscope. The most common site of tissue biopsy at the time of needle breakage was the pancreas (44 [23.8%]).The common patient-related adverse events were retained foreign body (n = 50 [14.5%]) followed by bleeding (16, 4.6%). Six patients (3.4%) required a second intervention for removal of the retained foreign bodies including surgery in 2 cases. The device breakage damaged the endoscope in 3 cases (1.7%), and there was 1 case of needlestick injury to the nurse. CONCLUSION: The fine-needle biopsy devices can be associated with needle breakage and bending; these adverse events were not previously reported. Needle breakages can result in a retained foreign body that may require additional procedures including surgery. These real-world findings from the MAUDE database may inform clinical decisions and help improve clinical outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) custom implants have been fundamental in addressing bone malformations and restoring traumatic defects within the field of craniofacial surgery. Although such implants are generally considered safe and appropriate alternatives to autologous bone grafts, there has been a lack of standardized reporting of adverse events associated with PEEK implants. The purpose of this study is multi-fold: (1) to explore the current landscape of autologous and allogeneic materials utilized for bone grafting; (2) to analyze and characterize adverse events associated within PEEK implants from the widely accredited, FDA-run database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE); and using the data, (3) to provide guidance to craniofacial surgeons using PEEK implants in their surgical practice. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective review of the adverse events associated with PEEK implants were performed through the FDA-run database, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). The database was surveyed from July 2013 to January 2023. Event types were categorized by injury or malfunction, and device-reported adverse events were recorded, respectively. RESULTS: Database search initially yielded 77 adverse event reports, but after duplicates were removed, 69 event reports were included in the analysis. These events were sorted into the following categories: device-related and patient-related. Event types were categorized by injury (48.3%) or malfunction (53.6%). The most common reported device-related adverse events were \"Poor Fit\" (53.6%) and \"Adverse Event without Identified Use or Problem \" (26.1%). The most common reported patient-related event was \"Infection\" (32.8%). Of these adverse event reports, 14 (20.2%) patients required a second surgery; 21(30.4%) required implant modification whereas in the operating room; 17 (24.6%) underwent implant removal. Nine (13%) patients experienced operative case delays due to implant modifications. CONCLUSION: Infection and poor fit were among the most commonly reported adverse events associated with PEEK customizable implants. Although PEEK implants have been widely implemented in addressing craniofacial bony defects, our database analysis does call for further investigation in studying the long-term outcomes associated with PEEK craniofacial implants. With such analyses and collaboration among plastic surgeons and device engineers, there is great opportunity for innovation of these devices.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize adverse events, provide a safety profile, and understand patient outcomes after complications arising from LigaSure and Harmonic use in the head and neck region. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of adverse events from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) between January 2013 and 2023. RESULTS: A total of 158 LigaSure and 159 Harmonic events were extracted. There were significantly more reports of Harmonic device overheating (6.9% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.003) and spontaneous self-activation (4.4% vs. 0%, p = 0.032). Although intra-operative and post-operative complications were similar among both groups, there were significantly more intra-operative bleeding events for LigaSure as compared to Harmonic (8.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Understanding technical complications and adverse events attributable to LigaSure and Harmonic devices enables the development of clinically relevant risk mitigation strategies. Surgeons should avoid improper use by remaining vigilant of device functionality and temperature changes.",

    "Title": "The burning truth about light therapy: a retrospective analysis of the MAUDE database on UV phototherapy and photodynamic therapy complications 2013-2023.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Phototherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) are ultraviolet light (UV) based therapies for patients with skin diseases, and are sometimes associated with potential adverse events (AE)s, including erythema, pain, pruritus, burns, and photoaging. METHODS: We investigated UV phototherapy and PDT safety using the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. The MAUDE database, including medical device reports (MDR)s informed by voluntary and obligatory reporters since 1991, was searched for AEs associated with UV phototherapy and PDT 1/1/91-3/1/23. RESULTS: There were 59 UV phototherapy and 33 PDT related MDRs. Burns were the most common AE type for both phototherapy and PDT. The majority of phototherapy AEs occurred during 2021 (52.3%), and were significantly more likely to occur at home than in the clinic. Overall, 76.1% of MDRs associated with home light boxes were prescribed by online retailers, most of the MDRs (59.3%) mentioned that it is prohibited to sell phototherapy devices not prescribed by physicians, and only 8.5% noted poorly written home light box instructions. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic prohibited in-person light treatments, and social distancing requirements may have resulted in increased frequency of home-based light treatments. Hence, while at home treatment may be easier and more accessible, in-office physician supervised UV treatments are associated with less frequent AEs. Moreover, some phototherapy MDRs reported poorly written instructions accompanying the home light box, and some PDT MDRs documented patients receiving inadequate education regarding the procedure. With the rise of at-home treatment options and the ease of obtaining devices on the internet, it is physicians' duty to advise patients against self-treating with home light boxes without prescribed treatment regimens and educate patients that are considering home phototherapy to ensure safer patient experiences.",

    "Title": "Real-World Experience With the Angio-Seal Closure Device: Insights From Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Angio-Seal (Terumo Medical Corporations, Somerset, New Jersey) device is indicated for femoral arteriotomy closure. Real-world published data on complications are limited. We present 1 year of safety events involving Angio-Seal from the US Food and Drug Administration's post-market surveillance database of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). Steps for managing frequent device-related problems are discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angio-Seal MAUDE data from November 2019 to December 2020 was classified according to (1) mode of device failure, (2) complication, (3) treatment, and (4) Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) adverse event classification system. RESULTS: There were 715 safety events, involving Angio-Seal VIP (93.1%), Evolution (5.7%), STS Plus (1.1%), and sizes 6F (62.5%) and 8F (37.5%). Failure mode involved unrecognized use of a damaged device (43.4%), failed deployment (20.1%), failed arterial advancement (6.3%), detachment of device component (4.9%), failed retraction (3.6%), operator error (1.1%), and indeterminate (20.6%). Of total, 44.8% of events were associated with patient harm. Complications involved minor blood loss (34.1%), hematoma (5.6%), significant blood loss (1.4%), and pseudoaneurysm (1.4%). Of total, 43.3% of cases required manual compression (MC), whereas 8.8% required more advanced intervention. Interventions included surgical repair (49.2%), thrombin injection (9.5%), balloon tamponade (6.3%), covered stent (4.8%), and unspecified (30.2%). Majority of safety events were CIRSE grade 1 (92.0%), followed by grades 2 (3.1%), 3 (4.6%), and 6 (deaths, 0.3%). Minority of devices were returned for manufacturer analysis (27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of safety events were associated with minor blood loss or local hematoma and could be addressed with MC alone. Most events were attributed to damaged device; however, very few devices were returned to manufacturer for analysis. This should be encouraged to allow for root cause analysis in order to improve safety profile of devices. System-level strategies for addressing barriers to under-reporting of safety events may also be considered. CLINICAL IMPACT: Our study highlights important safety events encountered in real-world practice with Angio-Seal closure device. The MAUDE database captures real-world device malfunctions not typically appreciated in conventional clinical trials. Our study provides valuable insight for clinician-users on anticipating and managing the most common device malfunctions. Additionally, our data provide feedback for manufactures to optimize product design and direct manufacturer user training to improve safety. Finally, we hope that the study promotes system-level strategies that foster reporting of safety events and undertaking of root cause analysis.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide an analysis of complications following eustachian tube balloon dilation as well as their treatments and outcomes. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Ovid Embase, and MAUDE Database. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic approach following PRISMA guidelines was used to identify publications pertaining to balloon dilation of the eustachian tube from PubMed and Ovid Embase databases was used. Once these publications were critically reviewed, the primary outcome extracted were reported complications. Additional complications were collected in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database using the product class \"eustachian tube dilation device\" and searching through relevant manufacturers. Complications and outcomes were compared between these sources. RESULTS: Fifty five full-length manuscripts involving 7155 patients were included and 98 complications reported for a 1.4% complication rate. The most frequently reported adverse events were subcutaneous emphysema of the head and neck (19%), epistaxis (12%), and acute otitis media (11%). The MAUDE search returned 18 distinct patient entries, of which 12 (67%) reported complications. The most reported complications in the MAUDE database included subcutaneous emphysema (8, 67%) and pneumomediastinum (3, 25%). The most serious complication was a carotid artery dissection reported in one patient in the MAUDE database. CONCLUSION: Eustachian tube dilation is rarely associated with complications, which nevertheless may lead to morbidity and medical emergencies. Patients and providers should recognize potential risks associated with this intervention as well as methods to manage complications.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Left atrial appendage closure is an alternative treatment to reduce thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom oral anticoagulation (OAC) is contraindicated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the complications profiles of the LARIAT and AtriClip devices and perform a comparison between them based on the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database. Materials and Methods: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched on 15 January 2023. For AtriClip, only reports regarding isolated procedures or procedures associated with minimally invasive ablation were included. Adverse effects and causes of death were defined based on the literature on the topic and the causes described in the reports. In total, 63 patients were included in the LARIAT group and 53 patients were included in the AtriClip group. Results: With the LARIAT device, the most common complication without device problems was pericardial effusion (n = 18, 52.9%), whereas this complication was not observed with AtriClip (p < 0.001). Postoperative bleeding was a second complication that occurred significantly more often in the LARIAT group-in 15 (44.1%) cases versus 1 (2.7%) case with AtriClip (p < 0.001). In addition, significant differences were found in the prevalence of stroke (LARIAT n = 0 vs. AtriClip n = 7, 18.9%, p = 0.012) and thrombus (LARIAT n = 2, 5.9% vs. n = 11, 29.7%, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Each type of left atrial appendage closure procedure is associated with device-specific requirements and complications that, if known, can be avoided.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate adverse events and device events related to accessories used during ureteroscopy (URS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis was performed of the records available in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database in the United States. Information was collected on characteristics of problem, timing, manufacturer verdict, successful completion of planned surgery, prolonged anaesthesia and injury to patient or staff. RESULTS: Five-hundred seventy-one events related to URS accessories were recorded. These were associated with the following devices: baskets (n = 347), access sheath (n = 86), guidewires (n = 78), balloon dilators (n = 27), ARDs (n = 17) and ureteral catheters (n = 16). Of the events, 12.7% resulted in patient injuries. Forty-eight per cent of the events resulted in prolonged anaesthesia, but the planned surgery was successfully completed in 78.4% of all cases. Collectively, the manufacturers accepted responsibility due to actual device failure in only 0.5% of cases. Common problems for baskets were failure to deploy (39.5%) and complete detachment of basket head (34.6%) and partial breakage of the basket head (12.4%). Of the basket group, 4.3% required open or percutaneous surgery to remove stuck basket. Full break of the body of the access sheath occurred in 41.9% and complete ureteral avulsion in 3.5%. For balloon dilators, there was a burst in 37% of cases. Broken guidewires were associated with 11.5% requiring repeat intervention for retrieval and 6.4% required JJ stent due to perforation to the collecting system. No injuries to operating staff were recorded with accessory usage. CONCLUSION: Accessories used during URS are fragile. Potential for serious injury does exist as a direct result of their use. Surgeons should familiarise themselves with these events and how they can be prevented.",

    "Title": "Development of an Improved LASER-Resistant Endotracheal Tube.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Surgical fires, particularly within Otolaryngology, remain a surprisingly frequent and devastating complication of laser-related surgery in the oropharynx and airway; Current estimates suggest anywhere from 200 to 600 surgical fires per year in the United States, with 20%-30% of these occurring as a complication of laser surgery and 90%-95% of these occurring in the head and neck region. Unfortunately, the complications of laser surgery in the airway may include respiratory failure, airway burns with stenosis, and may result in mortality. The most commonly utilized endotracheal tube for protection against inadvertent laser strikes, the Laser-Shield II tube (Medtronic), was removed from the commercial marketplace in 2016 after cases of airway fires were reported as a result of feature deficiencies in the product (FDA MAUDE Database review). Since the demise of the Laser-Shield II tube, alternatives such as the Mallinckrodt laser tube and handmade reinforced tubes have been utilized, although shortcomings in design and features have made these options less appealing to practicing Otolaryngologists. Creating a laser-safe endotracheal tube is critical for safe upper airway surgery. This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures. STUDY TYPE: This paper evaluates new technologies, materials, and technical innovations in endotracheal tubes that may advance patient safety in laser-assisted Otolaryngology procedures. METHODS: First, this article reviews the background of laser surgery in Otolaryngology and the consequent risk of surgical fire with resultant development of laser-resistant endotracheal tubes and commercial availability. Next, a review of claims and national database review of product failures related to previous laser-resistant endotracheal tubes is performed through the FDA MAUDE database. This includes an evaluation of cases: review of techniques in laser airway surgery including spontaneous ventilation, decreased O2 concentration, currently available endotracheal tubes including \"handmade\" fixes for perceived safety risks, and determination of failure points for previous laser-resistant endotracheal tubes. Third, the paper reviews the requested features of an \"ideal\" laser-resistant endotracheal tube. Finally, the paper reviews failure testing from an initial, unsuccessful attempt at material development and the consequent development of alternative technologies that address failure points from previous endotracheal tubes and addresses requested features with a detailed analysis of FDA-approval required testing. Extensive lab testing of the new tube predicts a significant reduction of risk in vivo with inability to perforate the shaft or cuff of the tubes under standard working conditions. RESULTS: While no iteration of a laser-resistant endotracheal tube is entirely laser safe, advances in technology can improve the safety profile of these devices. The new tube contains a double cuff, a soft and flexible shaft to minimize laryngeal insertion trauma, a smooth external surface, a tight-to-shaft balloon, and methylene blue dye in the cuff to alert the user to inadvertent penetration. These characteristics were the most requested by laryngologists in the development of a new laser-resistant tube. The newest endotracheal tube brings the features most requested by Otolaryngologists in a laser-resistant tube, and improves the safety profile over previous tubes. CONCLUSION: Development of a new endotracheal tube represents an advancement in safety for the Otolaryngologist in laser airway surgery. Understanding the previous history and the science behind surgical fire formation is essential in advancing safety for patients in the future. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A Laryngoscope, 134:S1-S12, 2024.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Guide catheter extensions (GCEs) are commonly used to facilitate percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). We investigated the incidence and modes of failure of GCEs.. METHODS: Data from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between 2012 and 2022 were used to investigate the most common modes of failure and related adverse events with the use of GCEs. We performed analysis of 4 commonly used catheters: GuideLiner (Teleflex), Guidezilla (Boston Scientific), TrapLiner (Teleflex), and Telescope (Medtronic). The first event reported for GuideLiner was in 2012, Guidezilla in 2018, TrapLiner in 2017, and Telescope in 2019. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 651 events were reported to the database. A total of 429 true GCE device failures were identified: 59 (14%) for GuideLiner, 297 (69%) for Guidezilla, 47 (11%) TrapLiner, and 26 (6%) for Telescope. Catheter detachment or fracture was the most frequently reported device failure for all 4 GCEs; these failures included shaft fractures, tip deformations, and collar detachments. We identified 222 reported events as unspecified adverse events; these events included device-to-device incompatibility, difficulty to advance, and device fractures outside the patient body. Only 58 (8.9%) events resulted in patient complication. Of these, coronary artery dissection was the most frequently reported complication. CONCLUSIONS: Device detachment/fracture is the most common mode of device failure in all 4 GCEs, and coronary dissection is the most common patient complication.",

    "Abstract": "With growing use of machine learning (ML)-enabled medical devices by clinicians and consumers safety events involving these systems are emerging. Current analysis of safety events heavily relies on retrospective review by experts, which is time consuming and cost ineffective. This study develops automated text classifiers and evaluates their potential to identify rare ML safety events from the US FDA's MAUDE. Four stratified classifiers were evaluated using a real-world data distribution with different feature sets: report text; text and device brand name; text and generic device type; and all information combined. We found that stratified classifiers using the generic type of devices were the most effective technique when tested on both stratified (F1-score=85%) and external datasets (precision=100%). All true positives on the external dataset were consistently identified by the three stratified classifiers, indicating the ensemble results from them can be used directly to monitor ML events reported to MAUDE.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leadless pacemakers represent a paradigm-changing advancement. However, they required innovative and novel device design, including the use of nitinol tines for fixation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the potential for fracture in the novel tine-based fixation mechanism. METHODS: A retrospective approach was used to search the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) database for events related to Micra pacemaker tine fracture and damage. Review of each report was performed to ascertain frequency of tine fracture and damage. RESULTS: Of 4241 MAUDE reports (2104 Micra VR, 2167 Micra AV), 230 included the terms \"fracture\" or \"tine,\" which yielded 7 tine fractures and 19 reports of tine damage. Overall, 2 (29%) of 7 tine fractures were noted during implantation, whereas 2 (29%) of 7 were discovered ≥1 week after implantation; 5 (71%) of 7 tine fracture reports described no associated patient signs or symptoms, and 4 (57%) of 7 described no change in pacing parameters. Tine damage occurred during implantation in 16 (84%) of 19, compared with 2 (11%) of 19 noted ≥1 week after implantation; 15 (79%) of 19 tine damage cases reported no associated signs or symptoms, and 7 (37%) of 19 described no changes in pacing parameters. Among all cases, there was 1 case of device embolization. CONCLUSION: The novel tine-based fixation mechanism appears susceptible to a novel failure mechanism-tine fracture and/or damage. Our analysis suggests these events may not always be associated with adverse signs or symptoms. Diligent attention at implantation, and future bench or clinical studies are needed to understand the rate, clinical impact, and mechanism of such failures, and role of surveillance.",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with the gold probe and the injection gold probe devices used for endoscopic hemostasis: A MAUDE database analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding accounts for over half a million admissions annually and is the most common GI diagnosis requiring hospitalization in the United States. Bipolar electrocoagulation devices are used for the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is no data on device-related adverse events for gold probe (GP) and injection gold probe (IGP). AIM: To analyze this using the Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2013 to 2023. METHODS: We examined post-marketing surveillance data on GP and IGP from the FDA MAUDE database to report devicerelated and patient-related adverse events between 2013-2023. The MAUDE database is a publicly available resource providing over 4 million records relating to medical device safety. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics V.27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). RESULTS: Our search elicited 140 reports for GP and 202 reports for IGP, respectively, during the study period from January 2013 to August 2023. Malfunctions reportedly occurred in 130 cases for GP, and actual patient injury or event occurred in 10 patients. A total of 149 patients (74%) reported with Injection GP events suffered no significant consequences due to the device failure, but 53 patients (26%) were affected by an event. CONCLUSION: GP and IGP are critical in managing gastrointestinal bleeding. This study of the FDA MAUDE database revealed the type, number, and trends of reported device-related adverse events. The endoscopist and support staff must be aware of these device-related events and be equipped to manage them if they occur.",

METHODS: We evaluated adverse events (AEs) associated with the SpyGlass system reported in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between January 2016 and August 2023. RESULTS: From the database, 2311 device problems (SpyGlass DS, 1301; SpyGlass DS II, 1010) were reported. An optical problem was the most reported issue (SpyGlass DS, 83; SpyGlass DS II, 457). Patient-related events were found in 62 of 1743 reports (3.5%): 33 with the SpyGlass DS and 29 with the SpyGlass DS II. The most common AEs were bleeding/hemorrhage followed by perforation; infection, fever, or sepsis; and pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings add to the existing literature and provide a fuller picture of potential problems associated with the SpyGlass SOC.",

MAUDE facilitates post-market surveillance, contributing to the assessment of device performance and the identification of potential safety concerns. The database is instrumental not only for mandatory reporters such as manufacturers and healthcare facilities but also offers a platform for voluntary submissions from clinicians and patients, thus widening the scope of data collection. While the database offers valuable data, there are important limitations that must be understood in order to encourage appropriate interpretation of findings.

    "Title": "Soft tissue injury events associated with neural integrity monitoring endotracheal tubes: A MAUDE database analysis.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neural integrity monitoring (NIM) endotracheal tubes are widely used to provide intraoperative monitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve during certain neck surgeries, especially thyroidectomy, in order to reduce the risk of nerve injury and subsequent vocal fold paralysis. The unique design of NIM tubes and the increased technical skill required for correct placement compared to standard endotracheal tubes may increase the risk of upper aerodigestive tract soft tissue injury. This study aims to describe adverse events related to NIM endotracheal tubes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: The US Food and Drug Administration's MAUDE database (2010-2022); (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience). METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of adverse events that resulted in patient soft tissue injury involving the use of endotracheal tubes approved by the Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: There were 28 reported soft tissue injuries, with all events being related to the NIM EMG family of endotracheal tubes manufactured by Medtronic Xomed, Inc. Overall, 24 were categorized as device-related adverse events, and 4 were unspecified in the event description. The most common soft tissue injuries were edema (n = 7) and perforation (n = 7), each accounting for 25 % of adverse events. The second most common injury type was laceration (n = 4), representing 14 % of all adverse events. Overall, 9 patients (32 %) in our cohort required a surgical intervention to treat their injuries, which consisted of 6 tracheotomies and 3 instances of suture repair. CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly reported types of soft tissue injury included edema and perforation, followed by laceration. Increased awareness of device-related patient injuries associated with NIM endotracheal tubes can be used to better inform surgeons and anesthesiologists during the process of intubation and surgical decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and severity of SpaceOAR-related adverse events using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: We analyzed SpaceOAR-related adverse event reports in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2015 to May 2023. For each report, the event type, associated device and patient problems, event description, event timing, and event severity stratified by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE) grading system were recorded. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2022, 206,619 SpaceOAR devices were sold. From January 2015 to May 2023, we identified 981 reports describing 990 SpaceOAR-related adverse events. Malfunctions were the most common event type (N = 626), followed by patient injuries (N = 350) with few reported deaths (N = 5). Device positioning problems were the most frequent device issue (N = 686). Pain was the most reported patient problem (N = 216). Abscesses and fistulas related to the device were each reported in 91 events. A noteworthy portion of relevant adverse events occurred before the initiation of radiation (N = 35, 22.4%), suggesting the device, rather than the radiation, was responsible. In total, 470 (50.2%) and 344 (36.7%) of the adverse events were CTCAE grade 1 and 2, respectively. There were 123 (13.1%) events that were CTCAE grade ≥3. CONCLUSION: We identified multiple reports of SpaceOAR-related adverse events, many of which are more serious than have been reported in clinical trials. While SpaceOAR use is common, suggesting these events are rare, these data highlight the need for continued postmarket surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "Post-market medical device-associated failures and patient problems are reported in Medical Device Reports (MDRs) to the US Food and Drug Administration. Reports are accessible through Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE), a database including both required and voluntary submissions. We present an overview of >10 million MDRs received from 2011 to 2021. Approximately 92% of reporting issues represent medical device physical or functional failures, categorized from 1704 codes related to medical device integrity or function. ∼8% were coded adverse events (AEs). Patient outcomes are reported via 998 patient codes in 19 medical specialties (cardiovascular, orthopedic, etc.). ∼40% of patient reports indicated \"no health consequences\"; however, a small number of devices had consistently high AE reports. While overall reports did not exhibit a sex-based dichotomy, ∼9% of the reported AEs occurred more frequently in females, many of which were related to immune effects. The analyses are subject to uncertainties and potential bias based on data available and data selected for analysis. However, such an overview of post-market MDR data, not previously published, fills a gap in understanding medical device issues and patient-based outcomes related to medical device use. Trends identified may be subjects of additional hypotheses, analysis, and research.",

    "Title": "Assessing the Reproducibility of Research Based on the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Data.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This article aims to assess the reproducibility of Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data-driven studies by analyzing the data queries used in their research processes. METHODS: Studies using MAUDE data were sourced from PubMed by searching for \"MAUDE\" or \"Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience\" in titles or abstracts. We manually chose articles with executable queries. The reproducibility of each query was assessed by replicating it in the MAUDE Application Programming Interface. The reproducibility of a query is determined by a reproducibility coefficient that ranges from 0.95 to 1.05. This coefficient is calculated by comparing the number of medical device reports (MDRs) returned by the reproduced queries to the number of reported MDRs in the original studies. We also computed the reproducibility ratio, which is the fraction of reproducible queries in subgroups divided by the query complexity, the device category, and the presence of a data processing flow. RESULTS: As of August 8, 2022, we identified 523 articles from which 336 contained queries, and 60 of these were executable. Among these, 14 queries were reproducible. Queries using a single field like product code, product class, or brand name showed higher reproducibility (50%, 33.3%, 31.3%) compared with other fields (8.3%, P = 0.037). Single-category device queries exhibited a higher reproducibility ratio than multicategory ones, but without statistical significance (27.1% versus 8.3%, P = 0.321). Studies including a data processing flow had a higher reproducibility ratio than those without, although this difference was not statistically significant (42.9% versus 17.4%, P = 0.107). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the reproducibility of queries in MAUDE data-driven studies is limited. Enhancing this requires the development of more effective MAUDE data query strategies and improved application programming interfaces.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Hyoid and tongue base suspension may treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This study summarizes device-related adverse events associated with the AIRvance and AIRLIFT systems used for hyoid and tongue base suspension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports describing adverse events associated with hyoid or tongue base suspension from January 2012 to December 2022. RESULTS: 77 adverse events were identified. When performed separately, adverse events were equally as common with hyoid suspension as with tongue base suspension. More complications occurred postoperatively (51 [66.2 %]) than intraoperatively (26 [33.8 %]). The most reported adverse events were infection (23 [29.9 %]), broken screw (15 [19.5 %]), pain or discomfort (10 [13.0 %]), suture rupture (8 [10.4 %]), and dislodged screw (7 [9.1 %]). 10 infections required drainage or debridement; 12 required device explantation. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the largest and most longitudinal review of adverse events associated with hyoid and tongue base suspension. Infection was the most common adverse event, and may require device explantation. While adverse events were most frequently attributed to device malfunction, broken screw, suture rupture, and broken needle were often attributed to operator error due to application of excessive force. Surgeon training to increase familiarity with hyoid and tongue base suspension may reduce adverse events caused by operator error. The MAUDE database is limited as a passive surveillance system. Standardized reporting may improve understanding of associated adverse events, enabling better informed comparisons between surgical treatment options for OSA.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database contains anonymous, voluntary medical device reports. A review of device-related adverse events associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia surgeries was completed. The objective was to evaluate the occurrence and contributing factors to clinically significant complications in a cohort of patients electing to undergo surgical intervention for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for \"Aquablation, Greenlight Laser, Holmium Laser, Morcellator, Water Vapor Thermal Therapy, Loop Resection, and Prostatic Urethral Lift\" from 2018 through 2021. A complication classification system (Level I-IV) based on the Clavien-Dindo system was used to categorize events. These events were then correlated with procedural technology malfunctions and classified as \"device related\" and \"non-device related.\" Chi squared analysis was performed to identify associations between procedural technology and complication classification distribution. RESULTS: A total of 873 adverse events were identified. The adverse events were classified into level I (minimal harm) versus levels II-IV (clinically significant). Aquablation (p < 0.017) and Water Vapor Thermal Therapy (p < 0.012) were associated with a higher proportion of reports with Level II-IV complications compared with other procedure types. Level II-IV complications were not associated with a reported device related malfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Aquablation and water vapor thermal therapy demonstrated noteworthy clinically significant complications which were not driven by device-related malfunctions.",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with anastomotic coupling devices in microvascular reconstruction.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Class 2 safety recall notice for anastomotic coupling devices, it is important to understand related adverse events. The aim of this study was to characterize adverse events in anastomotic coupling devices for microvascular reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis using the 2011 to 2021 US FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. All reports of adverse events involving anastomotic coupling devices were retrieved from the MAUDE database. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze categorized events. RESULTS: There were a total of 293 documented adverse events related to anastomotic coupling devices. These adverse events resulted in 91 (31.1 %) patient injuries and 239 (81.6 %) device malfunctions. The most frequent patient problems were thrombosis/hematoma (n = 38; 41.8 %), unspecified injury (n = 31; 34.1 %), and failure to anastomose (n = 13; 14.3 %). Free flap necrosis was reported in 42 % of thrombosis/hematoma cases (n = 16). The most common malfunctions were devices operating differently than expected (n = 74; 31.0 %), connection problems (n = 41; 17.2 %), and twisted/bent material (n = 19; 7.9 %). There was no significant trend in the number of adverse events over the study period (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events from anastomotic coupling devices represent an important and modifiable factor in free tissue failure. Adverse events are predominately related to devices operating differently than expected and may result in vascular compromise of the free flap. Reconstructive surgeons should be cognizant of defective anastomotic coupling devices and be prepared to utilize traditional hand-sewn anastomosis.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize adverse events and their root causes reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) hearing device (Med-El, Innsbruck, Austria), an active middle ear implant for patients with moderate to severe hearing loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for reports of VSB adverse events from January 1, 2012, to July 27, 2022. RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-three total medical device reports were identified, from which 913 adverse events were extracted. Of these, 498 (54.5 %) were adverse events to patients (AEPs), while 415 (45.5 %) were device malfunctions (DMs). The most common AEPs were hearing performance issues 428 (85.9 %). The most common DMs were compromised conductive link 125 (30.1 %). Root causes identified for DMs were iatrogenic 85 (58.6 %), patient-related 28 (19.3 %), and trauma and external causes 32 (22.1 %). The most common iatrogenic root cause 12 (14.1 %) involved damage to the conductive link during revision surgery. The most common patient-related causes of DMs were excessive middle ear tissue growth 16 (57 %), and abrupt body movements 5 (28.6 %). The most common external cause of DM was cleaning of the ear canal or mastoid cavity 20 (62.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its well-known limitations, the MAUDE database provides valuable information on possible complications of VSB as it relates to device malfunction or adverse events for patients. Implementation of standardized reports with relevant and well-defined categories could certainly allow for a more meaningful analysis.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic duct stents (PDS) are widely used for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the adverse events associated with PDS placement. This study aims to investigate the reported adverse events and device failures related to PDS, utilizing the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data from January 2013 to December 8, 2023, were extracted from the FDA's MAUDE database to analyze the reports pertaining to the use of commonly used PDS. The primary outcomes of interest were device issues and patient-related adverse events. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010, with the calculation of pooled numbers and percentages for each device and patient adverse event. RESULTS: A total of 579 device issues and 194 patient-related adverse events were identified. Device issues were primarily attributed to stent deformation (n = 72; 12.4%), followed by migration of the device into the pancreatic duct or expulsion out of the duct (n = 60; 10.4%), and stent fracture/breakage (n = 55; 9.4%). Among the patient-reported adverse events, inflammation was the most common (n = 26; 13.4%), followed by reports of stents becoming embedded in tissue (n = 21; 10.8%) and stent occlusion/obstruction (n = 16; 8.2%). The most prevalent device failures associated with Advanix stents were material deformation, with perforation (n = 3, 30%) being the most frequently reported adverse event. Concerning Geenen stents, migration or expulsion of the device (n = 34, 16.9%) constituted the most common device-related adverse events, while inflammation (n = 20, 16.7%) was the most frequently reported patient-related issue. For Zimmon stents, migration or expulsion of the device (n = 22, 8.8%) were the most frequently reported device-related problems, whereas perforation (n = 7, 10.9%) and bleeding (n = 7, 10.9%) were the most frequent patient-related adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight important device and patient adverse events that endoscopists and referring providers should be aware of before considering pancreatic stent placement.",

    "Title": "Infections Associated with Medtronic Duet External Ventricular Drains - Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, January 2023-January 2024.",
    "Abstract": "External ventricular drains (EVDs) are medical devices that are inserted into the ventricles of the brain to drain excess fluid, manage intracranial hypertension, monitor intracranial pressure, and administer medications. Unintentional disconnections and breaks or fractures (breaks) of EVDs or associated drainage system components can result in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and increased risk for EVD-associated infections. After replacement of Integra Life Sciences EVD systems with Medtronic Duet EVD systems at Rhode Island Hospital in mid-September 2023, a threefold increase was observed in the prevalence of positive CSF cultures, from 2.8 per 1,000 days with an EVD in place (EVD days) during January-September 2023 to 11.4 per 1,000 EVD days during October 2023-January 2024 (rate ratio [RR] = 5.7; 95% CI = 1.5-22.0; p = 0.01) and an eightfold increase in the prevalence of infections, from 0.7 to 6.5 per 1,000 EVD days (RR = 9.8; 95% CI = 1.1-87.3; p = 0.04). An investigation by Rhode Island Hospital Infection Control during December 2023-January 2024 identified frequent reports of disconnections and breaks of the Medtronic Duet EVD system. A search of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database identified 326 reports nationwide of disconnection and breaks of components of the Duet EVD system, including 175 during 2023. A Medical Product Safety Network report was filed. The Duet EVD product was ultimately recalled in January 2024, citing disconnections of the EVD system and reports of CSF leakage and infection. Given the widespread use of EVD systems by neurosurgery centers and the risk for EVD-associated infections, a strategy for future consideration by hospital infection prevention and control programs might be inclusion of EVD-associated infections in hospital surveillance programs to rapidly identify increases in these events and determine factors related to such infections to prevent additional infections.",

    "Title": "Major Clinical Adverse Events of Breast Implant in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Search the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database to collect information on adverse events of breast implant. We analyzed the local complications and the breast implant illness (BII) of silicone breast implants, as well as saline breast implants separately, aim to provide a reference for women who want to breast augmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for events reports related to the breast implant between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2022. Event year and reporting year were summarized. Patient problem was collected and analyzed to distinguish between local complications and BII. RESULTS: A total of 108,728 adverse events in the past 3 years were analyzed, silicone breast implants accounted for 62.1% and saline breast implants accounted for 37.9%. The most common local complication of women receiving silicone breast implants was \"Capsular Contracture,\" accounting for 48.73%. However, the incidence of \"capsular contracture\" in women who received saline breast implants was only 17.49%. The most common BII was \"fatigue/weakness\" in both women receiving 2 different breast implants, 17.20% in women receiving silicone breast implants and 24.71% in women receiving saline breast implants. Of note, in all the reports, there was a wide variation in the timing of reporting as compared with the timing of the adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Although the adverse events of breast implant cannot completely be determined from this study, we provide a reference for women who want to get breast implants, so that they can choose breast implants more carefully. In addition, a better understanding of BII may allow them to think further about whether the benefits of breast implants outweigh the risks.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Real-world clinical data, outside of clinical trials and expert centers, on adverse events related to the use of SyncCardia total artificial heart (TAH) remain limited. We aim to analyze adverse events related to the use of SynCardia TAH reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Manufacturers and User Defined Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: We reviewed the FDA's MAUDE database for any adverse events involving the use of SynCardia TAH from 1/01/2012 to 9/30/2020. All the events were independently reviewed by three physicians. RESULTS: A total of 1,512 adverse events were identified in 453 \"injury and death\" reports in the MAUDE database. The most common adverse events reported were infection (20.2%) and device malfunction (20.1%). These were followed by bleeding events (16.5%), respiratory failure (10.1%), cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/other neurological dysfunction (8.7%), renal dysfunction (7.5%), hepatic dysfunction (2.2%), thromboembolic events (1.8%), pericardial effusion (1.8%), and hemolysis (1%). Death was reported in 49.4% of all the reported cases (n=224/453). The most common cause of death was multiorgan failure (n=73, 32.6%), followed by CVA/other non-specific neurological dysfunction (n=44, 19.7%), sepsis (n=24, 10.7%), withdrawal of support (n=20, 8.9%), device malfunction (n=11, 4.9%), bleeding (n=7, 3.1%), respiratory failure (n=7, 3.1%), gastrointestinal disorder (n=6, 2.7%), and cardiomyopathy (n=3, 1.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Infection was the most common adverse event following the implantation of TAH. Most of the deaths reported were due to multiorgan failure. Early recognition and management of any possible adverse events after the TAH implantation are essential to improve the procedural outcome and patient survival.",

    "Title": "Themes, Rates, and Risk of Adverse Events of the Artificial Pancreas in the United States Using MAUDE.",
    "Abstract": "Three manufacturers sell artificial pancreas systems in the United States for management of Type 1 Diabetes. Given the life-saving task required of an artificial pancreas there needs to be a high level of trust and safety in the devices. This evaluation sought to find the adjusted safety event reporting rate and themes along with device-associated risk in events reported utilizing the MAUDE database. We searched device names in the MAUDE database over the period from 2016 until August 2023 (the date of retrieval). Thematic analysis was performed using dual-reviewer examination with a 96% concurrence. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for injury, malfunction, and overall, for each manufacturer, as well as adjusted event rate per manufacturer. Most events reported related to defects in the manufacturing of the casing materials which resulted in non-delivery of therapy. Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. had an adjusted event rate of 50 per 100,000 units and RR of 0.0225. Insulet had an adjusted event rate of 300 per 100,000 units and RR of 0.1684. Medtronic has an adjusted event rate of 2771.43 per 100,000 units and RR of 20.7857. The newer Medtronic devices show improvements in likely event rate. While the artificial pancreas is still in its infancy, these event rates are not at an acceptable level for a device which can precipitate death from malfunctions. Further exploration into safety events and much more research and development is needed for devices to reduce the event rates. Improved manufacturing practices, especially the casing materials, are highly recommended. The artificial pancreas holds promise for millions but must be improved before it becomes a true life-saving device that it has the potential to become.",

    "Title": "A Descriptive Analysis of Capsule Endoscopy Events in the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The malfunction of capsule endoscopy (CE) devices is a significant reason for the failure of CE procedures, which could hinder and prevent diagnosis. Unfortunately, malfunction-related adverse events (AEs) caused by CE devices are rarely reported in publications. Although most malfunction-related AEs could not lead to physical harm, they could reduce the efficiency of medical care and increase medical costs. The manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database, a publicly accessible resource for patient safety, contains not only the common complications of CE but also valuable malfunction-related AEs, which have been underutilized. Therefore, the study aims to discover and analyze the possible AEs associated with CE and demonstrate the utility of the MAUDE reports to promote patient safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We acquired MAUDE reports of CE systems from January 01, 2008, to July 31, 2020, through a systematic search strategy. We utilized the manufacturers, brand names, and product codes as search terms from which medical device reports including structured data and narrative texts were extracted, followed by a manual review of the narrative texts, reporter occupation, device involved, event type and the phase of the event; finally, patient outcomes were recorded and analyzed as per CE categories and characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 377 CEs medical device reports were retrieved, and 342 reports were included after reviewing. There were 327 mandatory reports (96%) and 15 voluntary reports (4%). These reports referred to capsule endoscope (n = 213), sensing system (n = 66), patency capsule (n = 38), and capsule delivery device (n = 26). A total of 349 CE-related AEs were identified, including complications (n = 228), malfunction-related AEs (n = 109), and other events (n = 12). The composition of AEs was not the same for the CE devices. Complications were major AEs of capsule endoscope and patency capsule, but malfunction-related AEs were the most common in AEs of sensing systems and capsule delivery devices. CONCLUSION: MAUDE serves as an invaluable data source for investigating malfunction-related AEs. In addition to common complications, malfunction of CE devices could threaten patient safety in CE procedures. Improving awareness of the malfunction of CE devices and raising adequate training for staff working in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic units could be critical and beneficial in preventing malfunction-related AEs.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Auditory Brainstem Implants (ABI) are used to restore hearing in patients lacking appropriate cochlear anatomy and/or cochlear nerve. The objective of this study was to examine the Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to analyze adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: This is a study of a multi-institutional database maintained by the US FDA. SETTING: A database analysis was performed via collaboration of multiple clinicians at tertiary referral centers. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for Medical Device Reports (MDRs) relating to ABIs. MDRs were identified using the advanced search term \"Implant, Auditory Brainstem\" and reviewing all reports with the basic search term \"Brainstem Implant\". All collected reports were individually reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 265 individual patient reports were reviewed, of which 55 reports met inclusion criteria. Reports regarding audiologic outcome included failure to provide hearing benefit (n = 27), implant failure/device malfunction (n = 10), and device non-use (n = 6). Postoperative complications included local skin infection (n = 3), CSF leak (n = 3), elevated ICP (n = 1), surgical site dehiscence (n = 1), swelling (n = 1), seroma formation requiring drainage (n = 1), and meningitis (n = 2). Two patients had dislodged magnets during 1.5 Tesla MRI acquisition. There were 35 instances of full explantation of the device and 1 partial removal; 13 patients had a new device implanted following explantation. CONCLUSIONS: Poor hearing results, device failure, and non-use were commonly reported causes for explanation in this analysis. This information can aid physicians in counseling patients and family members and managing device expectations.",

    "Title": "A Comprehensive Analysis of Reported Adverse Events and Device Failures Associated with Esophageal Self-Expandable Metal Stents: An FDA MAUDE Database Study.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Esophageal Stents are used to maintain esophageal lumen patency in esophageal strictures caused by intrinsic and/or extrinsic malignancies and the occlusion of concomitant esophageal fistulas. While data on the efficacy and safety of esophageal stents exist, comprehensive evaluation of adverse events is limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the reported adverse events and device failures associated with esophageal self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) using the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Post-marketing surveillance data for the esophageal SEMSs were analyzed using the FDA's MAUDE database from January 2014 to December 10, 2023. The outcomes of interest were patient-related adverse events and device failures. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS. Pooled numbers and percentages were calculated for each adverse event. Continuous variables underwent analysis using a two-tailed student t test, and significance was set to p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: During the study period, 548 MAUDE reports revealed 873 device failures and 186 patient-related adverse events. The most common device issues were stent activation, positioning, or separation problems (4 n = 403; 46.2%), followed by device detachment or migration (n = 109, 12.5%), and material problems (n = 93, 10.7%). Patient complications included dysphagia/odynophagia (10%), perforation, pain, and bleeding (each 7.6%). The most common device failures in over-the-wire (OTW) stents and through-the-scope (TTS) stents were activation, positioning, or separation problems (TTS: n = 183, 52.6% vs OTW: n = 220, 41.9%). Compared to OTW stents, TTS stents had higher migration and breakage (13.5% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.24), and (9.2% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.08) respectively, while OTW stents had more challenges with stent advancement or removal (5.1% vs. 0.3%, p < 0.001 and 4.6% vs 3.4%, p = 0.19, respectively) and material problems (14.7% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.001). Activation, positioning, and separation problems were the most frequent device failures in fully covered (FC) and partially covered (PC) stents (FC: n = 62, 32.8%, PC: n = 168, 43.5%). FC stents had higher migration rates (20.6% vs 9.8%, p < 0.001), while PC stents exhibited more material problems (17.4% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.001) and difficulties with advancing the stents (6.7% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our examination showed a prevalence of reported device complications associated with stent activation, positioning, and separation problems. Dysphagia or odynophagia emerged as the most frequently reported patient complication. Furthermore, our analysis, provides insights into TTS vs. OTW and FC vs. PC esophageal SEMSs, enabling endoscopists and manufacturers to better understand adverse events and potentially optimize device design for future iterations.",

    "Title": "What is the MAUDE Database Telling us about 510(k) Authorization? Evaluation of Two Generations of Endovascular Arteriovenous Fistula Devices.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2019, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc (BV; now Becton, Dickinson and Company; Sparks, Maryland) received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to begin marketing the WavelinQ EndoAVF System through a process known as 510(k) authorization. Such authorization relies on BV proving that the new WavelinQ EndoAVF System was of \"substantial equivalence\" to the WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System. We set forth to analyze patient problems and device issues reported for the new device and determine if they were significantly different from the predicate device its 510(k) approval was based on. METHODS: FDA database Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience was queried for all adverse report events for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System and WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System. Data were collected on patient issues and device issues. Fisher's exact test was used. RESULTS: There were a total of 125 reports for the WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System and 78 for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System. There was a significant increase in patient problem \"hypertension\" (0% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.02) for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System but a statistically significant decrease in device issue \"failure to align\" for the WavelinQ EndoAVF System (24.8% vs. 10.3%; P ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There were changes in device and patient outcomes between the WavelinQ EndoAVF System and WavelinQ 4F EndoAVF System. While we noted a decrease in device problem \"failure to align\", there was an overall increase in patients' \"hypertension\" rates. This highlights the importance of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience reporting in ensuring that device safety is maintained when devices are approved for marketing through the 510(k) process.",

    "Title": "Reasons for Revision Surgery After Cervical Disk Arthroplasty Based on Medical Device Reports Maintained by the US Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database review. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze revisions of CDAs reported to the MAUDE database. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical disk arthroplasty (CDA) has emerged as a motion-preserving alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative cervical disease, demonstrating comparable outcomes. Despite the availability of variable CDA designs, there is limited data on the specific complications of individual CDAs. The Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database has been used to systematically report complications associated with CDAs. However, data on specific reasons for CDA revision remains scarce. The purpose of this study is to compare common complications associated with revision for different CDAs. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried from January 2005 to September 2023, including all nine FDA-approved CDAs. The full-text reports of each complication were categorized based on whether revision surgery was performed, the complications and the type of CDA collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 678 revisions for nine CDAs were reported: Mobi-C (239), M6 (167), Prodisc-C (88), Prestige (60), PCM (44), Bryan (35), Secure (23), Simplify (21), and Discover (1). The top three complications associated with revision were migration (23.5%), neck pain (15.5%), and heterotopic ossification (6.6%). The most common complications per device were migration for Mobi-C (26.4%), Prodisc-C (21.3%), Prestige (24.6%), PCM (84.1%), Bryan (48.6%), Secure (30.4%), and Discover (100%). For M6, the most common complications associated with revision surgery were osteolysis (18.6%) and neck pain (18.6%), while neck pain (23.8%) was the most common for the Simplify. CONCLUSIONS: The MAUDE database highlights complications related to CDA revision in which the primary complications consistently include implant migration, neck pain, and heterotopic ossification, varying in their rerelvance depending on the CDA.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evolocumab and alirocumab are self-injected proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors indicated for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. Complications in the use or functionality of self-injection devices may precipitate incomplete dosing. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize postmarketing dosing failure reports involving self-injected PCSK9 inhibitors. METHODS: US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) [2016-second quarter of 2023] data were utilized for a disproportionality analysis. Eight self-injected comparator medications served as referents. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms indicating explicit or probable failure to administer a complete dose classified cases. Proportional reporting ratios (PRRs) > 2.0 and lower 95% confidence intervals (CIs) > 1.0 indicated disproportionality signals. US FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) [2013-2023] data underwent a narrative review. RESULTS: During the study period, 194,781 (evolocumab, n = 152,831; alirocumab, n = 41,950) drug-event pairs and 43,725 (evolocumab, n = 38,489; alirocumab, n = 5236) cases reported to FAERS identified PCSK9 inhibitors. MAUDE contained six evolocumab reports, half describing dose omission, and no alirocumab reports. A potential dosing failure signal was detected for evolocumab (PRR 2.01; 95% CI 1.98-2.03), but not alirocumab (PRR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97-1.02), relative to pooled comparator reports. Across three case term subcategories, incomplete dosing disproportionality signals were further identified for evolocumab patient usage complication terms (PRR 3.44; 95% CI 3.38-3.50) and alirocumab device malfunction terms (PRR 2.09; 95% CI 1.98-2.22). CONCLUSIONS: Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitor incomplete dosing-related complications are frequently reported in the postmarketing setting. Systematic efforts to understand the incidence and mechanisms of dosing failure and associated patient burdens are needed.",

    "Title": "Characterizing the safety profile of vagus nerve stimulation devices for epilepsy from 21,448 manufacturer and user reports.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study summarizes medical device reports (MDRs) associated with adverse events for vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) devices indicated for epilepsy as reported by the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: The MAUDE database was surveyed for MDRs from November 2013 to September 2022 regarding VNS devices for epilepsy. Event descriptions, device problems, correlated patient consequences, and device models were grouped and analyzed in Python. Based on event description, revision surgeries and other unique events were identified. Revenue from VNS device sales was used to approximate growth in their use over time. RESULTS: A total of 21,448 MDRs met the inclusion criteria. High VNS impedance, the most prevalent device malfunction overall (17.0% of MDRs), was the most common factor for 18 of the 102 encountered patient problems and led to 1001 revision surgeries (3371 total revisions). Included in those 18 device malfunctions were 3 of the top 6 occurring patient problems: seizure recurrence (9.9% associated with high impedance; encompassed focal, absence, and grand mal subtypes), death (1.3%), and generalized pain (7.9%). The next 4 top cited device malfunctions-lead fracture (13.7% of MDRs), operational issue (6.6%), battery problem holding charge (4.2%), and premature end-of-life indicator (2.9%)-differed widely in their percentage of cases that did not impact patients (77.4%, 57.3%, 48.9%, and 92.2%, respectively), highlighting differing malfunction severities. Seizure recurrence, the most prevalent patient impact, was the outcome most associated with 32 of the 68 encountered device problems, including high impedance (12.8%), lead fracture (12.2%), operational issue (18.4%), battery problem holding charge (31.2%), and premature end-of-life indicator (8.9%), which comprised the top 5 occurring device problems. In general, MDRs spanned a diverse range including device age, hardware, software, and surgeon or manufacturer error. Trends were seen over time with declining annual MDRs coupled with a rise in the use of VNS devices as gauged by revenue growth. Shifting device and patient problem profiles were also seen in successive models, reflecting engineering updates. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes the most common and consequential side effects of VNS devices for epilepsy while clarifying likely causes. In addition, the outcomes of 68 distinct device malfunctions were identified, including many not ubiquitously present in literature, lending critical perspective to clinical practice.",

    "Title": "Are There Hidden Adverse Events in Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation: Comparing Social Media and a Federal Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) can be an effective treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in positive airway pressure (PAP) intolerant patients. To better understand patient experiences with HNS therapy, we explored reported events from HNS-related Facebook groups and the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of HNS-related Facebook posts from three groups pertaining to HNS therapy, from October 1, 2022 to October 1, 2023, was performed. Posts were analyzed for patient-reported adverse events. Concurrently, the MAUDE database was reviewed for HNS-related events during the same timeframe. RESULTS: From 737 Facebook posts, 132 (17.55%) adverse events were identified. Adverse events included pain (34.85%), stimulation discomfort (14.39%), lip weakness (6.82%) and issues related to lead tethering or tight leads around the neck (3.79%). Analysis of the MAUDE database found 428 adverse events, including pain (24.07%), lip weakness (0.44%), and lead tethering (1.64%). CONCLUSION: Facebook group members reported higher rates of lip weakness and lead tethering than recorded in the MAUDE database. These findings illustrate how diverse data sources, such as social media, can enhance our understanding of patient experiences and identify gaps in patient education with HNS therapy.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the adverse events associated with hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS) implantation for treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), drawing data from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. We aim to provide a comprehensive and updated account of these adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: MAUDE Database review. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the MAUDE database to collect all HNS-related reports from May 2014 to December 2023. Variables collected included date of event, event description, nature of event, iatrogenic injuries, required interventions, and, if available, root causes. Each event description was analyzed to classify the adverse event, the postevent intervention, and device model number. RESULTS: Out of 1178 reports fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 1312 adverse events were identified. Common adverse events included infection (24.0%), pain (19.7%), and hematoma/seroma (10.2%). Approximately 83.1% of these adverse events necessitated medical and/or surgical intervention. The most frequent procedures included explantation (29.4%) and device repositioning (15.8%). Pneumothorax was reported in 50 cases, with 41 (82.0%) requiring a chest tube to be inserted. Three adverse events described overstimulation in the setting of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) despite the implantation of MRI-compatible second-generation internal pulse generators. CONCLUSION: While HNS implantation has been established as a reliable intervention for OSA in cases of continuous positive airway pressure failure or intolerance, this study highlights several perioperative and postoperative difficulties and complications. Understanding these challenges is essential for refining surgical practices and enhancing patient consent processes, ultimately aiming to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

    "Title": "Catheter-related and clinical complications associated with QDOT MICROTM Ablation Catheter.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The QDOT MICROTM Ablation Catheter is a next-generation ablation catheter that allows for high-power ablation up to 90 watts. METHODS: We aimed to assess AE associated with the QDOT MICROTM catheter using the MAUDE database. A MAUDE database search was conducted on May 25, 2024, to capture all AEs (since FDA approval) associated with this ablation catheter. RESULTS: A total of 302 AEs from November 23, 2022, to April 30, 2024, were reported including 148 (49%) catheter-related issues and 154 (51%) clinical complications. Among the catheter-related issues, physical catheter damage (74.3%, n = 110) was most common, followed by communication or display issue (10.8%, n = 16), irrigation issue (9.5%, n = 14), signal issue or artifact (3.4%, n = 5), and inaccurate temperature measurement (2.0%, n = 3). Regarding clinical complications, the most common AE was pericardial effusion (43.5%, n = 67), followed by char formation (11.7%, n = 18), catheter thrombosis (7.1%, n = 11), stroke (7.1%, n = 11), pericarditis (7.1%, n = 11), esophageal complications (6.5%, n = 10), phrenic nerve palsy (3.9%, n = 6), cardiac arrest (3.9%, n = 6), significant AV block (3.9%, n = 6), pulmonary vein stenosis (3.2%, n = 5), coronary artery spasm (1.3%, n = 2), and pulmonary embolism (0.6%, n = 1). There were 11 deaths (five related to esophageal complications, five related to cardiac arrest, and one related to pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade). CONCLUSION: As high-power ablation strategy with novel ablation catheters is becoming more widely utilized, operators must be aware of potential catheter-related issues and clinical complications that may arise. More data are needed to further evaluate risks of these complications to improve the catheter's safety and efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Ambu® aScope™ is a disposable flexible videoscope used for a wide range of medical procedures. However, adverse events associated with this device can occur. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was explored for patient-related adverse events associated with Ambu® aScope™ use between January 1, 2000 and December 15, 2023. Search terms included \"Ambu\" and \"Ascope.\" Thirty unique adverse events were identified. Twenty-one of the events were associated with patient injury, and 9 with device malfunction. Eight patient-reported problems were documented as foreign bodies, 3 events as airway obstruction, desaturation, or hypoxic events, and 1 event as anxiety/cardiac arrest. The remaining 18 reported insufficient information other than associated with patient injury. We found that Ambu® aScope™ flexible nasolaryngoscopes and bronchoscopes are a common and effective tool for airway evaluations that may infrequently serve as a rare form of foreign body with potentially life-threatening consequences.",

    "Abstract": "The MAUDE database is a valuable public resource for understanding malfunctions and adverse events related to medical devices and health IT. However, its extensive data and complex structure pose challenges. To overcome this, we have developed an automated analytical pipeline using GPT-4, a cutting-edge large language model. This pipeline is intended to efficiently extract, categorize, and visualize safety events with minimal human annotation. In our analysis of 4,459 colonoscopy reports from MAUDE (2011-2021), the events were categorized into operational, human factor, and device-related. Ishikawa diagrams visualized a subset stored in a vector database for easy retrieval and comparison through a similarity search. This innovative approach streamlines access to vital safety insights, reducing the workload on human annotators, and holds promise to enhance the utility of the MAUDE database.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify adverse events (AEs) related to suction electrocautery use during adenotonsillectomy. METHODS: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched using the terms \"suction cautery,\" \"suction electrocautery,\" \"suction Bovie,\" and \"suction coagulator\" from January 2014 to December 2023. RESULTS: 165 AE reports were gathered from the MAUDE database medical device reports (MDRs). 36 met inclusion criteria. Patient injuries were found in 22 (61.1 %) reports and device malfunction events were found in 14 (38.9 %) reports. All patient injuries were thermal burns (N = 22, 100 %). Location of burn injuries included the lip (N = 6, 27.3 %), oral commissure (N = 5, 22.7 %), and tongue (N = 4, 18.2 %). The most common cause of an AE was inadequate device insulation (N = 7, 19.4 %). CONCLUSION: The suction electrocautery apparatus may malfunction and cause patient burn injuries. Device failures mainly result from inadequate device insulation, coagulation problems, and detachment of device components. Surgeons must be aware of these potential complications and counsel parents and patients regarding AEs.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintains the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for reporting adverse events associated with medical devices, including emerging technologies, such as robotic-assisted total hip arthroplasty (THA). Aim of this study was to evaluate the variation of adverse events associated with robotics in THA. METHODS: Medical device reports (MDRs) within the MAUDE database were identified between 2017 and 2021. For MDR identification the product class \"orthopaedic stereotaxic equipment\" and terms associated with THA were used. Individual adverse events were identified and organised by type and consequences, such as patient injury, surgical delay, or conversion to the manual technique. RESULTS: 521 MDRs constituting 546 discrete events were found. The most common reported complication was intraoperative hardware failure (304/546, 55.7%), among which the most common failure was a broken impaction handle/platform (110, 20.1%). Inaccurate cup placement was the second most common reported complication (63, 11.5%). Abandoning the robot occurred in 13.0% (71/521) of reports. A surgical delay was noted in 28% (146/521) of reports, with an average delay of 17.9 (range 1-60) minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Identifying complications that may occur with robotics in THA is an important first step in preventing adverse events and surgical delays. Database analysis provide an overview of the range of complications.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Review of database. SETTING: Tertiary care neurotology center. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing adverse events. INTERVENTION: MAUDE database evaluation of Eustachian tube balloon dilation (ETBD) for the treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical device reports (MDRs) from the MAUDE database were analyzed for adverse patient events (AE) and device malfunctions (DM) among different devices for ETBD. The objective of this analysis is to assess AE rates and compare them across different devices. Sales data was also used to calculate AE rates. RESULTS: There were 18 MDRs noted in the MAUDE database for patients undergoing ETBD out of an initial 23 results. When separated into devices, the Aera had 9 total MDRs (50 %), Xpress had 8 (44.4 %) and Audion had 1 (5.6 %). There were 10 AE and 8 DM. When separated by device, Aera had 4 AEs and 5 DMs, Xpress had 5 AEs and 3 DMs, and Audion had 1 AE. The most common AE was subcutaneous emphysema (n = 4), in the head and neck region with one report of mediastinal involvement. Using this sales data, the Aera balloon has an MDR rate of 0.0128 % is established, with a rate of AE at 0.0058 %. The Audion balloon had an MDR and AE rate of 0.0164 %. CONCLUSIONS: ETBD is a safe procedure with minimal complications, with subcutaneous emphysema being the most commonly reported adverse event, consistent with literature findings. A comprehensive analysis of AE, coupled with sales data, indicates a commendably low MDR rate of 0.0128 % for the Aera balloon while the Audion balloon had an MDR rate of 0.0164 %. These findings offer valuable insights on post-procedure expectations and engaging in informed consent discussions with patients, highlighting the overall safety of ETBD as an intervention.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing use of MAUDE reports in patient safety research highlights the importance of understanding the processing and dissemination of open-access MAUDE data. However, the absence of a structured data pipeline undermines the reproducibility and transparency of studies relying on MAUDE data. In response, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of a recent study on endoscopic clips, assessing methodologies and results. We advocate for implementing an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline, utilizing openFDA and integrating keyword search strategies and data visualization techniques. This approach aims to enhance the quality of MAUDE-based studies, ensuring their reproducibility and transparency. Moreover, ETL serves as a cornerstone in data engineering, enabling real-time data management and quality assurance, thus promoting the sustainability and collaboration of MAUDE-based patient safety research.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a chatbot that simplifies accessing and understanding the open-access records of adverse events related to medical devices in the MAUDE database. The chatbot is powered by generative AI technology, enabling count and search queries. The chatbot uses the openFDA API and GPT-4 model to interpret users' natural language queries, generate appropriate API calls, and summarize adverse event reports. The chatbot also provides a downloadable link to the original reports. The model's performance in generating accurate API calls was assessed and improved by training it with few-shot examples of query-URL pairs. Additionally, the quality of content-based summaries was evaluated by human expert ratings. This initiative is a significant step towards making patient safety data accessible, replicable, and easily manageable by a broader range of researchers.",

    "Title": "Analysis of antibiotic resistant infections associated with hirudotherapy.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Given rising concern regarding antibiotic resistance, our objective was to evaluate antibiotic-resistant infections following leech therapy and to characterize the use of prophylactic antibiotics. METHODS: All reports of adverse events involving hirudotherapy (product code \"NRN\") were retrieved from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database between 2012 and 2021. Antibiotic resistance was defined by bacterial culture or infection after antibiotic administration. RESULTS: Nineteen cases of antibiotic resistance involving hirudotherapy were identified. Only three cases of antibiotic resistance were discovered on routine testing and the remaining 16 cases were associated with patient injury. Positive blood cultures or fever were present in 26.3 % (n = 5) of cases. Cultures of the infection grew Aeromonas hydrophilia (n = 13; 68.4 %), Vibrio vulnificus (n = 3; 15.8 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2; 10.5 %), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1; 5.3 %). There were nine (47.4 %) multi-drug resistant infections. Infection was most commonly resistant to fluoroquinolones (n = 9; 47.4 %), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 9; 47.4 %) and ertapenem (n = 4; 21.1 %). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic-resistant infections involving hirudotherapy are frequently resistant to multiple drugs, including fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to ertapenem, a drug of last resort, was also documented. The findings presented in this study support growing literature that the trend in multi-drug resistance is more severe than previously reported.",

    "Title": "Failure to treat ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation by implantable cardioverter-defibrillators.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Normally functioning implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with intact lead systems occasionally fail to deliver therapy for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) or deliver it only after clinically significant delays (failure-to-treat). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate ICD failure-to-treat VT/VF in a large patient cohort. METHODS: We searched the US Food and Drug Administration's online Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2019 to 2023 for manufacturer-verified reports in which normally functioning ICDs failed to treat VT/VF. RESULTS: We identified 854 reports classified as deaths (n = 96 [11.2%]), injuries (n = 585 [68.5%]), or malfunctions (n = 173 [20.3%]) for normally functioning ICDs. The most common causes were misclassification as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial fibrillation (AF; 54.8%), undersensing (21.1%), and failure to satisfy programmed rate/duration criteria (8.7%). Most events caused by misclassification as SVT/AF (89.5%) and failure to satisfy rate/duration criteria (70.3%) were VT; most caused by undersensing were either VF (54.4%) or not specified as VT or VF (19.4%). Undersensing caused 65.6% of deaths, although it represented only 21.1% of reports. In the United States, the number of reports increased faster than that of ICD patients. CONCLUSION: In the largest reported series of failure-to-treat VT/VF by normally functioning ICDs, the most common cause was misclassification of VT as SVT/AF; the most common cause of death was undersensing of VF. Although relatively few patients with normally functioning ICDs experience failure-to-treat VT/VF, the absolute number of verified MAUDE reports suggests that more work is needed to quantify the magnitude of the problem, to identify root causes, and to develop solutions.",

Outcome measures include specific ureteral stent and reported events as detailed by the MDRs. Data is presented as number of specific event/total events. Pooled Relative risk was used to compare data. RESULTS: 2652 reports were retrieved in 10 years and a progressive rise in reported events was recorded. 831/2652 (31%) were reported as injury while 1810/2652 (68%) as malfunction of the ureteral stent and 4 events of death. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were stent break (627/2652: 23%); material problems (384/2652: 14%); calcification (222/2652: 8%); difficulty to insert, advance or remove the device (155/2652: 6%). Bard stents were associated with most material problems (19%), Resonance stents were associated with most difficulty to insert, advance or remove the device (9%) and calcification (15%) while filiform double pigtail stent set were associated with most breakage reports (56%) when compared to the other stents (PRR > 1, p < 0,05). CONCLUSIONS: According to MAUDE database the most frequent complications related to ureteral stents are breakage, material problems, calcification and difficulty to insert/advance/remove the device. As well Resonance ureteral stents seem to be associated with a higher risk of device problems.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events of Femtosecond-Assisted Laser-Assisted In situ Keratomileusis: A Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database Study.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze the United States Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, which contains reports of adverse events involving medical devices, and characterize the most common adverse events of femtosecond (FS) laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried on May 19, 2022, for adverse events involving the ophthalmic FS laser reported from January 2012 to April 2022. Reports unrelated to LASIK procedures were excluded. Data extraction was performed on these reports, including the type of adverse event and whether surgery was successfully completed. Frequency analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. RESULTS: From the 3491 reported adverse events involving the FS laser system, 1136 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 672 cases where outcomes were reported, 476 were successfully completed and 196 were aborted. The most common intraoperative complications were incomplete cut (42.8%), thinner than intended flap (17.6%), and difficulty lifting the flap (12.0%). FS-related complications included opaque bubble layer (2.3%), air bubbles in the anterior chamber (2.4%), and vertical gas breakthrough (4.1%). Other device-related intraoperative complications included suction loss (10.2%), difficulty docking (2.4%), and laser malfunction (2.0%). The most common postoperative complications were diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK) (7.8%) and rainbow glare (4.6%). CONCLUSION: The most common intraoperative FS-assisted LASIK complication in the MAUDE database was an incomplete flap. The most common postoperative complication was DLK. This study is the first to investigate FS-assisted LASIK adverse events in the MAUDE database. It can raise awareness of real-world surgical complications and help ophthalmologists better counsel and treat patients.",

    "Title": "How Often Does Technology Fail in Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty? A Comprehensive Analysis of a United States Food and Drug Administration Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty is a growing alternative to conventionally instrumented arthroplasty; however, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with this technology reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains poorly quantified. The objective of this study was to categorize AEs associated with robotic-assisted arthroplasty and calculate their annual incidence as reported to the FDA. METHODS: The FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was queried for AEs from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 associated with the most prevalent robotic-arthroplasty system. The AEs were calculated using national surgical numbers provided by the manufacturer and grouped by total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). RESULTS: There were 1,710 unique AEs across the study period, with 436 THA, 1,005 TKA, and 269 PKA, representing incidence rates of 0.37, 0.30, and 0.40%, respectively. All procedures demonstrated lower rates of AEs in the final year of the study, compared to the first year. Most complications were related to mechanical problems, not software issues. Surgical delays due to AEs occurred in THA (0.13% cumulative incidence, 14.0 minutes average delay), TKA (0.13%, 20.6 minutes), and PKA (0.22%, 19.4 minutes). No cases were canceled due to AEs in THA, though a few TKA (0.003%) and PKA (0.02%) cases were not performed. Patient injuries occurred in 0.05, 0.05, and 0.08% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively. Surgical reintervention was necessary in 0.004, 0.003, and 0.01% of THA, TKA, and PKA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic-assisted arthroplasty has a small number and relatively low rate of AEs reported to the FDA as measured through the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database, with rates steadily decreasing over the study period. Patient injury, case delay, and reoperation represent only a small fraction of the already rare AEs in the database.",

    "Title": "Adverse events related to robotic-assisted knee arthroplasty: a cross-sectional study from the MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Robotic-assisted surgical technique has been clinically available for decades, yet real-world adverse events (AEs) and complications associated with primary knee arthroplasty remain unclear. METHODS: In March 2023, we searched the FDA website and extracted AEs related to robotic assisted knee arthroplasty (RAKA) from the MAUDE database over the past 10 years. The \"Brand Name\" function queried major robotic platforms, including active and semi-active systems. The overall incidence of AEs was estimated based on annual surgical volume from the current American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR). Two authors independently collected data on event date, event type, device problem, and patient problem. RESULTS: Of 839 eligible reports, device malfunction comprised mechanical failure (343/839, 40.88%) and software failure (261/839, 31.11%). For surgical complications, inappropriate bone resection (115/839, 13.71%) was most frequent, followed by bone/soft tissue damage (83/839, 9.89%). Notably, over-resection exceeding 2 mm (88/839, 10.49%), joint infection (25/839, 2.98%), and aseptic loosening (1/839, 0.12%) were major complications. Only two track pins related AEs were found. Moreover, the distribution of these AEs differed substantially between robot manufacturers. According to the AEs volume and AJRR data, the overall incidences of AEs related to RAKAs were calculated with 0.83% (839/100,892) between November 2010 and March 2023. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that while reported AEs might be increasing for RAKAs, the overall rate remains relatively low. Reassuringly, device malfunction was the most commonly AEs observed, with a minor impact on postoperative outcomes. Furthermore, our data provide a benchmark for patients, surgeons, and manufacturers to evaluate RAKA performance, though continued improvement in reducing serious AEs incidence is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To identify and describe adverse events (AEs) observed with real-world use of the following 3 vitrectomy platforms: Constellation (Alcon), Enhancing Visual Acuity (EVA, Dutch Ophthalmic Research Center), and Stellaris (Bausch + Lomb). Methods: All reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between January 2010 and November 2021 that were associated with the 3 vitrectomy platforms were analyzed. Each report was reviewed for AEs or consequences and the type of complication noted. Duplicates and reports with an inadequate narrative to categorize the event were excluded. A descriptive analysis was performed for the prevalence of device-specific issues within each platform. Results: The analysis included 2534 reports (1738 Constellation, 117 EVA, 679 Stellaris). Overall, the most commonly reported complications involved the vitrectomy probe (n = 957 [37.8%]) and the central processing unit (n = 368 [14.5%]). Differences in the distribution of AEs among the platforms were noted, with vitrectomy probe issues being the most reported events for the Constellation and Stellaris and infusion issues for the EVA. Infusion issues most frequently led to reports of patient harm with the Constellation (31/1738 [1.8%]) and EVA (7/116 [6.0%]), while issues with the vitrectomy probe were reported with the Stellaris (11/679 [1.6%]). Conclusions: An analysis of real-world data in the MAUDE database highlighted the spectrum of device-specific AEs of greatest relevance to surgical practice. Familiarity with potential device complications will help minimize harm to patients.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interspinous process devices (IPDs) introduce a new class of complications to surgical decompression without fusion: hardware-related complications. The purpose of this study was to describe the adverse events associated with IPDs. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. METHODS: The database was queried from its inception to November 2022 for reports associated with \"Prosthesis, Spinous Process Spacer/Plate.\" Entries were categorized by event type, patient impact, and interventions. RESULTS: A total of 943 surgery-related adverse events were identified. The most common intraoperative events were implant malfunctions (39.7%, n = 374) and fractures (2.2%, n = 21). The most common postoperative events were persistent pain (26.6%, n = 251), implant migration (19.1%, n = 180), and fracture (6.8%, n = 64). The most common resultant outcome of an adverse event was the need for revision surgery (48.8%, n = 460). The need for revision surgery was common in patients who experienced fracture (47.1%), implant migration (84.5%), infection (76.7%), and neurological complications (76.9%). Implant migration, fracture, and implant malfunction, 3 complications that are unique to decompression with an IPD as compared with traditional laminectomy, accounted for 45.9% of revisions (211/460), and revision was required in 33.0% of cases where 1 of these complications was reported (211/640). Implant malfunction made up 21.2% of Coflex complications, 47.3% of Superion complications, and 5.2% of X-Stop complications. CONCLUSIONS: The most common adverse events were implant malfunction, inadequate efficacy, implant migration, and fracture. Concerningly, these complications require revision surgery in one-third of cases when they occur. Implant-specific assessments demonstrate a high prevalence of implant malfunctions for the Coflex and Superion implants. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interspinous process devices introduce a new class of complications to isolated spinal decompression surgery: implant-related complications. These complications occur both intraoperatively and postoperatively, and they frequently necessitate revision surgery.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyze medical device reports (MDR) submitted to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Device Facility Experience (MAUDE) database to identify adverse events (AEs) in patients implanted with novel active bone conduction hearing implants (BCIs). METHODS: We conducted a search of the FDA MAUDE database on the newest generation of BCIs. Data were collected concerning device malfunctions, patient injuries, factors triggering these incidents, and the subsequent actions taken. RESULTS: In total, 93 (16.7%) device malfunctions and 465 (83.3%) patient injuries with 358 subsequent interventions were identified, resulting in 558 AEs. Although the absolute AE number per device cannot be identified, the following trends were detected: Among the 494 AEs associated with OSI200, 55 (11.1%) reported device malfunctions and 454 (88.9%) cited patient injuries. Out of the 64 AEs linked to BCI602, 28 (59.4%) were associated with malfunctions, whereas 26 (40.6%) involved patient injuries. The most frequently reported particular AEs for the OSI200 were infection (n = 171, 34.6%), extrusion of the device (n = 107, 21.7%), and pain (n = 51, 10.3%). Conversely, no device output (n = 20, 31.3%) and loss of osseointegration (n = 7, 10.9%) were the most reported AEs for the BCI602. Various AEs led to 214 explanations and 77 revision surgeries. Sixty-seven AEs reported conservative treatment. CONCLUSION: The current study provides an overview of the most commonly reported complications with new active BCIs. Although providing an overview, given the limitations of the FDA MAUDE database, our results have to be interpreted with caution. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports of adverse events involving medical devices marketed in the United States submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by mandatory and voluntary reporters. The MAUDE database is frequently used in clinical studies to report on device-related complications. Data about its efficacy are scarce. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the mandatory MAUDE database (MAUDE group) with the invitation-based POTTER-AF study (POTTER-AF 1 group) regarding data quality, procedural characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and survival. METHODS: The reports of esophageal fistula esophageal fistula following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in the MAUDE database were compared with those in the POTTER-AF study between August 1, 2009, and August 31, 2019. RESULTS: Esophageal fistulas were reported in 47 patients in the MAUDE group and in 81 in the POTTER-AF 1 group. Procedures were performed with radiofrequency, cryoenergy, or laser energy in 66.0%, 31.9%, and 2.1% (MAUDE group) and in 96.3%, 2.5%, and 1.2% (POTTER-AF 1 group). The median time to symptoms was 21 (14, 32.5) days (MAUDE group) and 18.0 (6.8, 22.3) days (POTTER-AF 1 group; P = .031). The diagnostic method was reported in 38.3% of patients in the MAUDE group and in 98.8% in the POTTER-AF 1 group, the treatment in 57.4% and 100%, and the outcome in all patients. In the MAUDE group, treatment was surgical (51.9%), endoscopic (37.0%), combined (3.7%), or conservative (7.4%), compared with 43.2%, 19.8%, 7.4%, and 29.6% in the POTTER-AF 1 group. Overall mortality was 76.6% in the MAUDE group and 61.7% in the POTTER-AF 1 group (P = .118). CONCLUSION: In the mandatory MAUDE database, fewer esophageal fistula cases were reported compared with an invitation-based study. The data quality in the MAUDE database was significantly poorer.",

    "Title": "Adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines during ureteroscopy and stone lithotripsy: Insights from an updated 10-year analysis of the US MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ureteroscopy has become increasingly chosen as a treatment of choice for patients with kidney stone disease and laser as the energy source for stone lithotripsy is a key part of this. Our aim was to analyse a national database to evaluate the burden of adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines. METHODS: Search was performed of the Manufacturer User and Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in the United States for all events related to holmium laser fibers and holmium laser machines during ureteroscopy between 2012-2021. Information collected included the following: problem, timing, prolonged anaesthesia, early termination of procedure, injury and retained parts. RESULTS: 699 holmium laser fiber events were reported and these had been manufactured by 13 different companies. The commonest problems were breakage outside the patient while in use (26.3%) and breakage of the laser fiber tip (21.2%). Manufacturers concluded root cause to be device failure in 8.9%. 29% of issues occurred before the laser had been activated. 5.2% of cases had to be cancelled as a result of an event. Significantly more injuries were sustained intra-operatively by operating staff compared to patients (6% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). All these injuries were superficial burns to the skin with the hand being the most affected body part (88.1%). Zero ocular injuries were reported. Only eight events were related to laser machines and all involved sudden hardware failure but no patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: Laser fibers are fragile. Most adverse events are due to operator error. Direct patient injury from laser fiber is scarce but operating staff should be aware of the risk of sustaining minor burns. Laser machines rarely incur problems and, in this study, did not result in any safety issues beyond need to abort the procedure due to lack of spare equipment.",

    "Title": "Adverse events of the endoscopic over-the-scope clips and cutters: a Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Ovesco clip system (Tübingen, Germany), including the over-the-scope clip and full-thickness resection device, has demonstrated efficacy in managing various GI pathologies. However, real-world data on device malfunctions and patient adverse events are limited. This study aimed to analyze adverse events associated with Ovesco clips and cutters reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for reports related to Ovesco clips and cutters from January 1, 2007, to August 30, 2024. Event date, device type and model, manufacturer, event type, device problem, and patient adverse events were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings. RESULTS: Forty-two reports were identified, with 41 involving Ovesco clips and 1 involving an Ovesco cutter. The most common device problem for Ovesco clips was failure to deploy (61.0%), followed by unintended deployment or misfiring (17.1%). GI perforation was the most frequently reported patient adverse event (60%). The Ovesco cutter report described device component breakage and foreign body retention. No clear trends in adverse event reporting were observed over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Ovesco clips and cutters are associated with potential device malfunctions and patient adverse events, particularly GI perforation. The findings highlight the need for careful patient selection, meticulous technique, and close postprocedural monitoring. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders are essential to optimize device safety and efficacy. Continued postmarketing surveillance and real-world data analysis are crucial for monitoring the performance of endoscopic devices and improving patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the real-world safety profile of medical devices used in focal prostate cancer treatment utilizing the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Methods: The MAUDE database was searched for reports on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryoablation, laser ablation, and irreversible electroporation (IRE) devices used in prostate cancer treatment from 1993 to 2023. Adverse events were identified and categorized. Results: We identified 175 reports for HIFU, 1362 for cryoablation, 615 for laser ablation, and 135 for IRE devices, with 28, 284, 126, and 2 respective reports, directly related to prostate cancer treatment. The aggregated data revealed the majority of complications were minor, with 82.5% (n = 363 out of 440 total complications) classified as Clavien-Dindo grade 1 or 2. Common minor complications included erectile dysfunction and urinary retention. Severe complications such as rectal fistulas were noted in HIFU and IRE treatments, along with singular mortality due to pulmonary embolism in cryoablation. Conclusions: Our analyses from MAUDE reveal that devices used in focal therapy for prostate cancer are predominantly associated with minor complications, underscoring their overall real-world safety profile. However, the occurrence of severe adverse events emphasizes the critical importance of rigorous patient selection and meticulous procedural planning. These findings provide valuable insights into the safety profile of focal therapy devices and contribute to the growing body of evidence on their use in prostate cancer treatment.",

    "Title": "Pulmonary Artery Injury Following Endocardial Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion: The Known and Unknown.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is frequent alternative for stroke prophylaxis in patients for whom oral anticoagulation is contraindicated. Pulmonary artery injury (PAI) is a feared yet rare complication of endocardial LAAC, but its surrounding literature is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to review prior PAI published reports and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to understand evidence and mechanisms of PAI after LAAC. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of the literature and MAUDE database for previously reported cases of PAI, and cases were reviewed for patient characteristics and outcomes. In addition, we identify risks and review our strategies to avoid this injury. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases (16 case reports and 20 MAUDE reports) of PAI were found. These patients had a mean age of 73.6 ± 8.2 years with a median CHA2DS2VASC score of 5 (Q1-Q3: 3-6). Most commonly, LAAC associated with PAI involved a dual-seal (75%) followed by lobular occlusive devices (19.4%); the device was unspecified in 2.8% of cases. PAI commonly presented postprocedurally, either within the first 24 hours (50%) or beyond (38.9%), with cardiac tamponade (61.1%) or cardiac arrest (19.4%). Overall, 52.8% required surgery with or without antecedent pericardiocentesis, and 16.7% were managed with pericardiocentesis. PAI was associated with a high mortality rate (ie, 33.3%). Unfortunately, no specific cardiac imaging or procedural details to predict PAI were noted in the reports. CONCLUSIONS: Presentation of PAI after LAAC can occur immediately following the procedure or be delayed. Thus, the threshold for suspicion, especially with rapid and hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, after LAAC should be low.",

    "Title": "Device dislodgement and embolization associated with a new leadless pacemaker.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Currently, there are two approved single chamber leadless pacemakers (LP) in the United States (US), Micra VR™; approved since 2016 and AVEIR VR™; approved in 2022. A potential complication of LPs is dislodgement and/or embolization (D/E) during or after implant. According to the IDE trials, there appears to be a significant difference in D/E rates between the two LPs that have different fixation mechanisms; Micra uses nitinol tines, while AVEIR uses an active screw helix. The aim of this study was to determine if the AVEIR VR LP has continued to exhibit D/E in the United States since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2022. METHODS: The FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for US D/E reports communicated by the manufacturers of both LP devices. For AVEIR VR we reviewed reports from approval till December 2023, and for Micra VR we looked at reports from approval to April 2024. Excluded were reports based on information indirectly obtained from registries, journals, social media, or volunteers. Total number of US implants was acquired from the manufacturers' product performance reports. RESULTS: During a period of 21 months, 5990 AVEIR VR implants had been registered in the United States, of which 53 (0.88%) encountered D/E both during and after the procedure. More D/E (32; 60.4%) occurred during the implantation procedure, with device release problems being the most prominent procedural issue involved with these events. Within a 8-year period, 72 237 Micra VR implants have been registered in the United States, of which 211 (0.29%) showed D/E. The rate of D/E since the US approval of both devices was significantly higher for AVEIR VR compared to Micra VR (0.88% vs 0.29%; p < .0001). CONCLUSION: AVEIR VR implants may be complicated by dislodgement with or without embolization. Currently, the estimated incidence is about 0.9%, which is significantly higher than Micra VR. Fixation issues and separation problems of the device from the delivery catheter appear to be responsible for most of these D/E events.",

    "Title": "An Analysis of the Complication Reports of Expandable Lumbar Interbody Cages in the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Expandable lumbar interbody cages (ELICs) are commonly used for interbody fusion and provide lordotic correction by lengthening the anterior column of the vertebral spine. We sought to identify unique failure mechanisms and significant differences in the types of complications associated with ELICs as reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MAUDE Database was analyzed for complication reports submitted for ELIC systems between January 2013 and July 2023. Reports were categorized by manufacturer, brand name, type of expandable cage, type of complication, year of complication, and reporter identity. Reports that were duplicated or had insufficient information were excluded from analysis. The top 5 manufacturers with the most implant-related complications were independently analyzed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 821 reports were analyzed. The top 5 complications reported across all manufacturers were cage breakage during insertion (25.7%), postoperative migration without collapse (16.0%), postoperative collapse (15.6%), inserter breakage (11.1%), and tubing problems (3.0%). A significant difference was detected in complication type between manufacturers (χ2=557, P<.001). The largest number of reports (120, 14.6%) was in 2016. CONCLUSION: With FDA approval of novel ELIC systems and the adoption of newer surgical techniques, understanding the range of potential complications is paramount in ensuring patient safety. This study of the MAUDE Database provides a comprehensive summary of adverse reported events associated with ELICs during the past decade. [Orthopedics. 2025;48(1):e7-e14.].",

    "Title": "Complications associated with pulsed field ablation vs radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The first commercial systems for pulsed field ablation (PFA) were recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but their safety profile in nationwide practice remains underexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe reported adverse events with PFA systems after their market release and to compare the relative proportion of complications associated with PFA vs radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. METHODS: We conducted a search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database for adverse event reports involving Food and Drug Administration-approved PFA and RF catheters from January 1, 2024, to July 31, 2024. RESULTS: A total of 1237 reports detailing clinical complications (n=156 for PFA and n=315 for RF) or catheter malfunctions (n=336 for PFA and n=430 for RF) were analyzed. The most common adverse events reported for PFA were pericardial effusion, vasovagal response, and hemolysis, compared with pericardial effusion, ischemic stroke, and esophageal damage for RF ablation. The proportion of reported adverse events that were deaths was lower with PFA than with RF (2.6% vs 8.9%; P=.010). Hemolysis (9.0% vs 0%), coronary events (5.8% vs 0.6%), and vasovagal responses (14.1% vs 0%) were reported more frequently after PFA (P<.001 for all). In contrast, esophageal damage (0% vs 4.1%; P<.001) and pulmonary vein stenosis (0% vs 1.9%; P=.184) were not reported with PFA, but only with RF. Regarding catheter malfunctions, mechanical problems were reported in higher proportion after PFA than after RF (87.2% vs 17.2%; P<.001). CONCLUSION: The reported complications associated with PFA and RF ablation differ significantly. Close attention to PFA-specific complications is essential for ensuring the safe use of PFA and for mitigating risk.",

    "Title": "Understanding Variation Among Medical Device Reporting Sources: A Study of the MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing medical device usage raises concerns regarding unexpected, potentially life-threatening events that pose public health risks. Such events are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and cataloged in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, a vital tool for post market surveillance that requires information of high quality and integrity, particularly concerning reporting sources. PURPOSE: To analyze reporting behavior among different reporters, including manufacturers, distributors, and user facilities, by examining differences in reported factors, namely: (1) device types, (2) product problem attribution, and (3) selection of Device Problem Codes (DPCs) associated with the root causes of events. METHODS: Data spanning from 2005 to 2022 was retrieved from the MAUDE database using Python. Reports were grouped by reporter type and divided according to device type, and the reporter's indication of association with a product problem. Furthermore, events were classified by their respective DPCs, which were manually grouped into four categories: device issues, user issues, clinical issues, or unknown. FINDINGS: The analysis revealed significant variations among reporters across all examined aspects (P < 0.00001 in all comparisons according to the proportion test). Manufacturers predominantly focused on infusion pumps (10.1%) and Implant, Endosseous, Root-Form (IER) devices (7.6%), with a product problem indication rate of 29.2% in their reports. Device issues codes were the most frequently observed category in their reports, comprising 36.3%, followed by unknown codes (32%) and clinical codes (19.3%). Distributors, on the other hand, primarily reported on IER devices (89%) and exhibited the lowest product problem indication rate at 2.7%. Clinical issues codes predominated in their reports, constituting 85.7%, followed by unknown codes (6.7%). User facilities concentrated on intravascular sets (4.7%), Electrosurgical, Cutting & Coagulation & Accessories (4.2%), and Ventricular (Assist) Bypass (4.1%). Remarkably, their product problem indication rate was the highest at 56.7%. They predominantly reported device issues codes (54.3%), followed by use codes (30.8%), and unknown codes (11.4%) IMPLICATIONS: The notable variation among different reporters underscores the importance of incorporating diverse sources when analyzing the database, particularly in cases where majority of reports originate from manufacturers. Decision-makers must approach database information comprehensively, considering data sources and diverse perspectives to inform regulatory decisions effectively. Developing strategies that encourage various reporters to contribute their unique and complementary viewpoints is advisable.",

    "Title": "An Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database for MAGnetic Expansion Control Spinal Rods.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: MAGnetic Expansion Control (MAGEC) rods can prevent repeated lengthening operations for scoliosis patients. However, there have been several Field Safety Notices issued, including a worldwide product recall due to actuator endcap separation. We aimed to review adverse events reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding MAGEC rods, focusing on MAGEC X. METHODS: Reports submitted to the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database in relation to MAGEC devices were accessed and analysed using R Statistical Software. Exclusion criteria included duplicate and literature review reports (n = 54). Free-text data were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: 1016 adverse events were reported to 11/30/2023. 99.0% (1006) were submitted by the manufacturer. Reports primarily arose from the UK (465, 45.8%) or US (421, 41.4%). From free-text data the most frequent adverse events were distraction mechanism failure (573), device wear (272), and actuator seal damage (180). Rod fracture (n = 48) was not significantly associated with rod diameter (≤ 5.0 mm or > 5.0 mm), p = 0.736. 234 reports referenced MAGEC X devices; actuator endcap separation was identified in 41.9% (99). Other events include failure of distraction (63), surface damage (31), and rod fracture (15). On 06/30/2020 MAGEC X2 received FDA approval. Twenty reports reference devices manufactured after this date, seven describe distraction mechanism failure; notably there are no reports of endcap separation. CONCLUSION: These data represent the largest series of adverse events reported for MAGEC rods, including significant new data regarding MAGEC X. As well as endcap separation, failure of distraction, surface damage, and rod fracture were reported.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: The study was a retrospective cross-sectional database analysis. OBJECTIVE: Deoxycholic acid (DOC) injections are a novel, in-office procedural alternative to submental liposuction or submentoplasty to address excess submental fat. Post-market safety data regarding this treatment is currently limited. The objective of this study is to analyze adverse events reported in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for all reports related to adverse events involving deoxycholic acid using the search terms \"KYBELLA\" and \"deoxycholic acid.\" Reports were individually reviewed by 2 reviewers and categorized with special attention to adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 34 medical device reports were identified from the database query. Thirteen of these reports (21 total events) were included in the analysis after excluding duplicates, unrelated adverse events, or events associated with the off-label use of DOC. Reported adverse events include excessive swelling (n = 5, 24%), marginal mandibular nerve weakness (n = 4, 19%), unsatisfactory aesthetic outcome (n = 4, 19%), numbness (n = 3, 14%), dysphagia (n = 1, 5%), infection (n = 1, 5%), and skin necrosis (n = 3, 14%). Two patients required hospitalization for skin necrosis management; both had underlying systemic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events following DOC injections included excessive swelling, dysphagia, numbness, infection, unsatisfactory aesthetic outcome, facial nerve weakness, and skin necrosis requiring hospitalization and/or surgery. Patient counseling regarding these adverse events should be discussed when offering DOC injections for submental convexity.",

    "Abstract": "To identify real-world complications involving flanged scleral tunnel fixation of Zeiss CT Lucia 602 intraocular lenses, the Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (FDA MAUDE) was searched by Manufacturer field for Zeiss with the terms \"Yamane\" and \"scleral fixated\". Reports containing these terms were reviewed to confirm technique and categorize adverse events. The search yielded 178 confirmed reports of lens malfunctions for CT Lucia 602 between 2013 to 2024, with 95% of reports in the last 3 years. The most common complication was lens tilt (94 reports), followed by breakage (53) comprised of haptic-optic disinsertion (31) and haptic breakage (22). Intraoperatively, 118 (66.3%) complications occurred, and 60 (33.7%) occurred postoperatively. Temporal analysis revealed that the number of reports to MAUDE has shown a ten-fold annual increase since 2020. Reports suggest haptic breakage is a noteworthy malfunction for CT Lucia 602 lenses. The occurrence of intraoperative breakage and lens tilt may be higher than previously expected in real-world settings. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina 2025;56:123-125.].",

    "Title": "A Retrospective Study of the Adverse Events Associated With Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the adverse events reported in the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)'s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for over-the-counter (OTC) or non-prescription hearing aids. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed using the USFDA's MAUDE database from January 2014 to August 2024. Adverse events were identified using the product codes (QUF, QUG, and QUH) and the keywords (\"Hearing Aid, Air-Conduction with Wireless Technology, Over the Counter, Hearing Aid, Air-Conduction, Over the Counter, and Self-Fitting Air-Conduction Hearing Aid, Over the Counter\"). Exclusion criteria included reports unrelated to OTC hearing aids and the usage of the device, or those providing insufficient information. The incidence of adverse events was estimated using data from market research reports. RESULTS: A total of 25 adverse events were identified, with 17 reports meeting the inclusion criteria. Medical device reports (MDRs) were available for 2022 (n=1), 2023 (n=9), and 2024 (n=7). Eighteen (60.0%) reports were related to device malfunction, six (20.0%) were regarding poor customer service, three (10.0%) referred to medical adverse events, two (6.7%) were associated with failure to provide hearing benefits, and one (3.3%) referred to incompatibility with other medical equipment. Nine (30.0%) of the device malfunction reports were due to poor construction or the device falling apart, with eight (88.9%) of those cases resulting in foreign bodies in the ear. The incidence rate of adverse events for OTC hearing aids was calculated as 0.00132%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a low reported incidence of adverse events associated with OTC hearing aids. Possible poor construction of the device and its falling apart, resulting in foreign bodies in the ear, and poor customer service were commonly reported as adverse events. This information can aid providers in advising patients and managing expectations. However, more robust studies are needed to monitor adverse events associated with OTC hearing aids.",

    "Title": "Microfocused Ultrasound With Visualization: A Systematic Review of Adverse Events and Risk of Subsequent Facelift Compromise.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plastic surgery colleagues have expressed unconfirmed concerns regarding the deleterious implications of noninvasive energy-based therapies for skin laxity, such as microfocused ultrasound with visualization (MFU-V), on preexisting facial fat or subsequent surgical facelifts. OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review to summarize treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) following MFU-V and elucidate their impact on future rhytidectomies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search using the keywords \"MFU-V,\" \"fat loss,\" \"adverse events,\" \"facelift,\" and their derivatives. In addition, the authors searched the manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database using the brand name \"Ulthera.\" RESULTS: Nineteen articles with data on 506 patients were identified. Transient edema, erythema, and postprocedural pain were observed most often. Instances of significant TRAEs were limited in the scientific literature, apart from 1 case of subcutaneous atrophy. Data from 106 records were extracted from the MAUDE database. Notably, lipoatrophy, neurologic sequelae (including nerve damage, focal numbness, dysesthesia, and ptosis), and scarring were reported with the most frequency. There was 1 report of facelift compromise. CONCLUSION: While the scientific literature lacks supporting evidence regarding the impact of MFU-V on subsequent facelift procedures, anecdotal, largely unverified reports exist. Hence, peer-reviewed literature detailing such occurrences would be valuable in understanding the potential ensuing risks.",

    "Title": "The Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Device Reporting and Investigation.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In May 2020, the FDA released guidance about medical device reporting during a pandemic, anticipating delays in reporting and investigating events involving medical devices. METHODS: We aimed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted medical device reporting by analyzing reports in the MAUDE database that mention COVID-19. RESULTS: From the 816,470 reports submitted between January 1 and July 31, 2020, 3,500 (0.43%) included phrases related to COVID-19. Of these reports, 4.8% (167/3,500) described adverse events during COVID-19 patients' treatment, and 90.3% (3,161 /3,500) described barriers manufacturers faced investigating malfunctioning devices during the pandemic. 4.9% (172/3,500) of reports were not related to COVID-19. Malfunctions were clinically significant in 85.8% (3,004/3,500) of reports. DISCUSSION: Reports indicate challenges some manufacturers had when investigating medical devices during the pandemic. The pandemic made investigating implants uniquely difficult, as restrictions to person-to-person contact limited the type of care patients could receive. Because full-scale investigations into malfunctioning devices may be difficult to perform during the pandemic, safety issues may go unaddressed and result in future harm to patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the myriad of healthcare, travel, and shipping challenges it created impacted how manufacturers reported and investigated medical devices. At the current time, it is unclear how manufacturers will address delayed clinical management of implant devices and other uninvestigated malfunctions after the pandemic and how this will impact patient safety.",

    "Title": "Surgical Site Allergic Contact Dermatitis Due to 2-Octyl Cyanoacrylate: A Systematic Review and FDA MAUDE Review.",
    "Abstract": "Skin adhesives containing 2-octyl cyanoacrylate are a common source of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), a complication of postoperative wound healing. Few studies have described postoperative cutaneous reactions to skin adhesives and their clinical management. The aim of this study was to review the incidence, descriptions, and clinical management of surgical site ACD caused by 2-ocyl cyanoacrylate. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in September 2023 of the PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA), and Cochrane databases (Cochrane Library, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Hoboken, NJ) for studies reporting ACD after skin closure with liquid adhesives containing 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. Additionally, we queried the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (FDA MAUDE, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD) in September 2023 and retrieved clinician-inputted records of ACD caused by liquid adhesives containing 2-octyl cyanoacrylate from 2014 to2023. Nine articles were included for review, with a median of 102 patients exposed to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate for surgical site skin closure. The reported incidence of cutaneous reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate ranged from 0.5% to 14%. The review also included 609 unique FDA MAUDE records reporting surgical site skin reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. Orthopedic procedures were the most common type of procedure, representing 47% of FDA MAUDE records. Nineteen clinical descriptors of cutaneous reactions were utilized. Topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines were the most commonly prescribed treatments to manage postoperative cutaneous reactions. Reported incidences of cutaneous reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate vary widely and guidelines for clinical management remain unclear. The FDA MAUDE provides important insights to cutaneous reactions to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate including surgery-type, cutaneous descriptors, and clinical management. Future research is needed to identify patients at risk of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate skin reactions in the preoperative setting.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events and Failure Modes Related to Impella RP/RP Flex: Insights From FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impella RP and RP Flex can provide right ventricular (RV) support in numerous clinical situations. Notably, the redesigned RP Flex allows for an internal jugular approach compared to the femoral venous approach with RP. AIMS: We investigated the type and frequency of device-related complications as reported in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Experience (MAUDE) for both Impella RP and RP Flex to see if there are any differences. METHODS: The MAUDE database was accessed from January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2024, yielding 206 reports pertaining to Impella RP and 64 to RP Flex. Reports were reviewed for device indications, mode of device failure, and device-related complications. RESULTS: The most common indication for Impella RP placement was acute myocardial infarction with RV failure. The most commonly reported failure mode was pump failure. Death was reported in 8.5% and vascular complications in 3.7% of the reports. The most reported device-related complication was hemolysis (18.5%), followed by bleeding requiring transfusion (14.1%), with new dialysis occurring in 3.3% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the MAUDE database showed that device delivery issues, bleeding, and vascular complications accounted for a smaller proportion of reports with Impella RP Flex than with its predecessor. However, device-related thrombosis and pump malfunction accounted for a higher proportion of reports with RP Flex. These data do not reflect the overall incidence of complications, but instead highlight the need for physicians and other healthcare providers to return devices to the manufacturer for inspection when a failure occurs.",

    "Title": "Procedure-Related Mortality in Aspiration Thrombectomy for Pulmonary Embolism: A MAUDE Database Analysis of the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo Systems.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important cause of death and disability. Advances in catheter-directed therapies have led to the use of devices, such as the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo system for aspiration thrombectomy (AT) for both massive and sub-massive PE. However, limited data exist on causes of procedural mortality. METHODS: Analysis of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacture and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was performed. Data for the Inari FlowTriever and Penumbra Indigo aspiration thrombectomy systems were evaluated for mortality events and classified by cause of death from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023. RESULTS: The review identified 26 mortality events related to the Inari FlowTriever and 28 related to the Penumbra Indigo device. Pulmonary vascular perforation (n=26) and right heart injury/tamponade (n=9) were the most common source of mortality. Clot migration (n=4) and acute right heart failure (n=5) were less frequently observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals more mortality events than have been captured in the literature to date. Vascular perforation and cardiac injury are the most common and also potentially preventable sources of mortality. Strategies to mitigate complications related to aspiration thrombectomy are described. CLINICAL IMPACT: Analysis of mortality in aspiration thrombectomy (AT) for acute pulmonary embolism is necessary to better understand the safety profile of this procedure. This analysis of the MAUDE database reports the largest single cohort of 54 deaths. Potentially preventable procedure-related mortality in AT has been documented to be the result of vascular perforation and cardiac perforation with tamponade. Preparation for emergent pericardiocentesis should be considered in mechanical thrombectomy. Clot migration may result from thrombus maceration or migration of clot in transit, thus, careful pre-procedure examination for clot in transit with echocardiography is suggested.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endoscopic bariatric interventions are viable alternatives to traditional weight loss surgeries for patients with a body mass index between 30 and 40 kg/m2. While studies have explored the impact of intragastric balloons on obesity and weight reduction, comprehensive data on real-world device-related complications and failures are limited. This study aimed to investigate mechanical failures leading to patient adverse events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration. METHODS: A retrospective analysis using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database examined device-related events and patient outcomes associated with various intragastric balloons from July 2017 to October 2023. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software to assess the reported events and their associations with specific types of intragastric balloons. RESULTS: Our review included 1393 cases, revealing 1758 device malfunctions and 1760 patient complications. Deflation problems (25.31%) and balloon leakage or rupture (21.90%) were the most common device-related complications. Patient complications were primarily linked to the Orbera balloon, with implant failure (24.30%), abdominal pain (21.92%), and vomiting (21.26%) as leading adverse events. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need for continuous surveillance, rigorous monitoring, and enhanced safety protocols for intragastric balloons.",

    "Title": "Device-related patient outcomes for coronary stents: A MAUDE database analysis.",
    "Abstract": "The growing prevalence of coronary artery diseases in the US corresponds to the increasing use of minimally invasive techniques that require coronary stents. Although extensive research is available on the perioperative outcomes of the 3 stent options - bare-metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents (DES), and bioresorbable drug-eluting stents (BVS), a knowledge gap exists in the longitudinal monitoring of patient outcomes due to device-related causes. Therefore, our study examines the device-related patient outcome and the relative performance for BMS, DES, and BVS. Data on 3 device outcomes (deaths, injuries, and malfunction) for each stent type was obtained from the January 2011 to February 2020 Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. Statistical visualizations and analysis were used to identify trends and significant differences between groups. Of a total of 68,618 adverse event reports, DES, BMS, and BVS each accounted for 88.5 %, 10.2 %, and 1.25 % of the cases, respectively. Device malfunctions were the most reported event (47.2 %), followed by injuries (44.1 %) and deaths (8.66 %). Over time, BMS malfunction rates showed a steady decrease (R = -0.87), while DES malfunction rates increased significantly (R = 0.79). An inversely proportional relationship between DES injuries and malfunctions was observed. The increase in DES malfunctions was 4 times greater than the decrease in BMS malfunctions. Approximately 7 % of reported adverse events were classified as misreported, with most involving DES. These results suggest 2 plausible interpretations: 1) reporting categorization for devices shifted from injuries to malfunction, and 2) stents choice is transitioning from BMS to DES. Our findings also highlight the need to improve reporting accuracy for MAUDE database data.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated with Surgically Implanted Temporomandibular Joint Devices.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a common, yet potentially debilitating syndrome that negatively impacts patient quality of life. In patients with severe variants of TMD, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) devices have been utilized to replace the joint altogether. However, the risk profile and consequent cost-benefit ratio of these devices are largely debated. This report aimed to provide further insight on the safety of surgically implanted TMJ devices by analyzing adverse events from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: Inclusion criteria consisted of all MAUDE reports from January 2013 to January 2023 containing the keyword \"TMJ.\" Duplicate reports, preimplantation events, reports extrapolated from published literature reviews, and those not related to TMJ implants were excluded from analysis. Adverse events were extracted, reviewed, and categorized according to complication type, management strategy, device manufacturer, causes of device malfunction, and reporting timeframe. Nonparametric χ2 and Levene's test were used to compare average values between groups with a two-tailed p value of 0.05 being considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 385 adverse event reports were reviewed. The most common complications were infection (59, 25.9%), ankylosis (57, 25.0%), and pain (33, 14.5%). The most common device failures were implant malposition (28, 39.4%), implant dislodgement (22, 31.0%), and screw osseointegration failure (11, 15.5%). Upon assessment of revision surgeries, those undertaken to address infections had the highest rate of device explantation (77%). In a separate analysis of 28 adverse events submitted directly by patients, infection was most common self-reported complication (42.9%). Comparison of device manufacturers revealed that Biomet implants had significantly more reports of pain (χ2 = 10.21, p = 0.003), whereas Stryker implants had more infections (χ2 = 29.87, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In summary, this in-depth analysis of adverse events provides a safety profile of TMJ implants. Understanding the complication types, management strategies, and outcomes according to device manufacturer may help set patient expectations and improve patient care.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) technique, facilitated by the MitraClip device, is a minimally invasive intervention designed for high-risk patients with mitral regurgitation (MR). This study conducts a retrospective analysis of death events associated with MitraClip implantation over a ten-year decade, utilizing data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to evaluate trends in safety outcomes. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the publicly accessible MAUDE database was conducted to retrieve reports of deaths and injuries related to MitraClip implantation from October 2013 to September 2023. Duplicate reports and records from unrelated sources were excluded. The Cochran-Armitage test was performed to evaluate trends in the proportion of fatal events over time. RESULTS: During the 10-year period following FDA approval, the MAUDE database recorded a total of 927 death reports and 9,211 injury reports associated with MitraClip. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant reports, 592 death cases were analyzed. The most commonly reported complications were MR (26.69%), tissue damage (24.16%), and hypotension (22.13%). The most frequent device-related issues were incomplete coaptation (14.70%), difficulty removing the divice (6.42%), and failure to adhere or bond/positioning failure(4.90%). Notably, 76.94% of deaths occurred within one year of implantation. The proportion of fatal events demonstrated a gradual decline, from 15.9% in 2014-2015 to 3.5% in 2020-2021 (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of the MAUDE database indicates a gradual decline in the proportion of fatal events associated with MitraClip implantation, which may be attributed to growing operator experience and advancements in device design. Nonetheless, persistent focus is required on managing complications and addressing potential risks to further enhance device performance and optimize its clinical utility.",

    "Title": "Complications associated with use of the Wolverine cutting balloon: insights from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The Wolverine cutting balloon (CB) (Boston Scientific) is a specialized balloon catheter with microsurgical blades that is used for balloon-resistant lesions. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database serves as a repository for reports of medical device complications. The aim of this study was to analyze complications associated with CB use during percutaneous coronary intervention in real-world contemporary practice. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2023 for reports of complications associated with CB use. Data from individual reports were extracted for analysis. RESULTS: The final analysis included 2278 complications, of which 97.3% (n = 2216) were associated with device malfunction, 2.4% (n = 55) were associated with patient injury, and 0.3% (n = 7) were associated with patient death. The most common complication overall was balloon rupture (n = 1847), while the most common complication associated with patient injury or death was device entrapment (n = 33). The median number of inflations was significantly higher for complications associated with patient injury or death (3 [IQR 1-8]) compared with complications associated with device malfunction (1[IQR 1-2]) (P = .0035). The median maximum inflation pressure was significantly higher for complications associated with patient injury or death (12 [IQR 11-15] atm) compared with complications associated with device malfunction (8 [IQR 6-10] atm) (P = .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 2.7% of reported complications were associated with patient injury or death. The most common complication overall was balloon rupture. Device entrapment was the most common complication among reports associated with patient injury or death. Higher inflation pressures and greater number of inflations may be associated with adverse outcomes.",

    "Title": "Evaluation of reporting trends in the MAUDE Database: 1991 to 2022.",
    "Abstract": "UNLABELLED: Adverse event reporting for medical devices is critical for risk mitigation. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database serves as a key tool for post-market surveillance, receiving reports from various sources. Ensuring information integrity, especially across diverse reporting sources, is paramount. Periodic regulatory updates aim to enhance reporting. OBJECTIVE: Analyze reporting patterns, assess the potential contribution of 2015 and 2018 regulatory updates on reporting rates for varies reporters. Additionally, evaluating reporting schedule compliance by comparing average reporting times to regulatory requirements for these reporters. METHODS: Data from 1991-2022 was retrieved from the MAUDE database. Annual report counts were filtered by reporter and event type. Average reporting time was calculated as the difference between received and awareness dates. RESULTS: The 2018 Voluntary Malfunction Summary Reporting (VMSR) program correlated with an increase in manufacturers' event reporting, peaking at 3,135,501 events in 2022. Distributors' reports surged post-2018, while voluntary reports steadily increased since 1997, spiking notably in 2015 with the Electronic Medical Device Reporting (eMDR) submission update. Reporting times for deaths averaged 80 days for manufacturers, far exceeding regulatory requirements, compared to 40 days for distributors and 46 days for user facilities. Malfunction events had longer average reporting times for manufacturers (89 days) compared to distributors (44 days). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in reporting trends around 2015 and 2018 may be linked to regulatory updates. Tailoring regulatory changes for each reporter type, like user-friendly electronic forms, new reporting programs, and exemptions cancelations, can improve reporting. Balancing the volume of reports among different reporters is crucial for enhancing database integrity, transparency, and overall health outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To examine the adverse events reported in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (U.S. FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for prescription hearing aids (HA). Methods A retrospective study was performed from January 2014 to September 2024 using the U.S. FDA's MAUDE database. Medical device reports (MDRs) were identified using product codes (ESD, OSM, and QDD) and keywords (\"Hearing Aid, Air-Conduction, Prescription; Hearing Aid, Air-Conduction with Wireless Technology, Prescription; and Self-fitting, Air-Conduction Hearing Aid, Prescription\"). Exclusion criteria included reports unrelated to the usage of the device or those providing insufficient data. The incidence of adverse events was estimated using the Hearing Industries Association's market data over the last 10 years. Results A total of 586 medical device reports (MDRs) were identified, and 504 met the inclusion criteria. There were 4 (0.8%) MDRs identified in 2014, 7 (1.4%) in 2015, 7 (1.4%) in 2016, 11 (2.2%) in 2017, 7 (1.4%) in 2018, 27 (5.4%) in 2019, 50 (9.9%) in 2020, 24 (4.8%) in 2021, 119 (23.6%) in 2022, 174 (34.5%) in 2023, and 74 (14.7%) in 2024, up to the third quarter. Of the 504 MDRs, 829 total events were identified. The mean number of events per MDR was calculated as 1.9. Four hundred and ninety-four (59.6%) of the 829 events were related to device malfunction, with 180 (21.7%) attributed to charger-related issues and 137 (16.5%) to poor construction/device falling apart, resulting in foreign bodies in the ear for 96 (70.1%) of those 137 cases. A total of 303 (36.6%) events were related to adverse medical effects, 19 (2.3%) were related to customer service issues, and 11 (1.3%) were related to failure to provide hearing benefits. The incidence rate of adverse events over the last decade was calculated as 0.00114%. Conclusions There is a low reported incidence of adverse events associated with prescription hearing aids. Charger issues, possible poor construction and device failing apart, resulting in foreign bodies in the ear, and medical complications, were commonly reported as adverse events. The data can increase providers' awareness of common complaints, enhance targeted monitoring, and advise and manage expectations.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhinolaryngoscopes are one of the most widely used tools by otolaryngologists and speech-language pathologists in current clinical practice. However, there is limited data on adverse events associated with or caused by the use of rhinolaryngoscopes. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database with the aim of providing insights that may assist otolaryngologists in better understanding the limitations of these devices and selecting appropriate procedures for their specific clinical setting. METHODS: We characterized complications associated with the postmarket use of rhinolaryngoscope devices from the US Food and Drug Administration MAUDE database from 2016 through 2023. RESULTS: A total of 2591 reports were identified, including 2534 device malfunctions, 56 injuries, and 1 death, from 2016 through 2023. The most common device problem with rhinolaryngoscopes was breakage (n=1058 reports, 40.8%), followed by fluid leaks (n=632 reports, 24.4%). The third most common problem was poor image quality (n=467 reports, 18%). Other device issues included contamination or device reprocessing problems (n=127 reports, 4.9%), material deformation or wear (n=125 reports, 4.8%), and device detachment (n=73 reports, 2.8%). Of the 63 reported adverse events, the most common patient-related adverse event was hemorrhage or bleeding, accounting for 18 reports, with the root causes including material deformation or wear, breakage, wrinkled rubber, or improper operation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers valuable insights for endoscopists and manufacturers to recognize potential issues and adverse events associated with the use of rhinolaryngoscopes. It emphasizes the need for improving device reliability, training, and procedural protocols to enhance patient safety during diagnostic procedures.",

    "Title": "A comprehensive analysis of MRI-related Cochlear implant adverse events reported by FDA's manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Identify MRI-related cochlear implant (CI) adverse events from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database and determine whether devices with diametric magnets are associated with reduced adverse events. METHODS: Data on MRI-related adverse events were collected from the MAUDE database for reports filed between 01/01/2013 and 01/29/2023. Outcomes and interventions were manually extracted. Device problems, electrode designs, and correlated patient problems were grouped and analyzed using R. RESULTS: All CI complications were derived from three manufacturers: Cochlear Limited, Advanced Bionics, and MED-EL. MRI-related CI complications occurred in 668 of 32,446 reports (2.1%). MRI-related CI complications increased from 32 reports (4.8%) in 2013 to a peak of 142 reports (21.3%) in 2019 and decreased to 56 reports (8.4%) in 2022. The most common MRI-related device problems were dislodgment/dislocation (39.9%, n = 266) or migration/expulsion (33.4%, n = 223). The most frequently identified patient problems identified were pain (31.6%, n = 211), hearing impairment (4.9%, n = 33), unspecified medical problems (3.7%, n = 25), implant failure (3.0%, n = 20), and injury (1.5%, n = 10). Of these, 358 reports (53.6%) contained the date of device manufacture. The median MDR per year decreased from 11 in the 3 years before each manufacturer released their MRI-conditional CI to 0 in the 3 years following the release (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of MRI-conditional CIs has successfully reduced MRI-associated adverse events. There have been no reported cases of MRI-related CI complications for devices containing the new MRI-conditional magnets for each of the three major US manufacturers. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",

    "Title": "A Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Medical Device Recall by the Food and Drug Administration.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medical device recalls are important to the practice of emergency medicine, as unsafe devices include many ubiquitous items in emergency care, such as vascular access devices, ventilators, infusion pumps, video laryngoscopes, pulse oximetry sensors, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. Identification of dangerous medical devices as early as possible is necessary to minimize patient harms while avoiding false positives to prevent removal of safe devices from use. While the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) employs an adverse event reporting program (MedWatch) and database (MAUDE), other data sources and methods might have utility to identify potentially dangerous medical devices. Our objective was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a machine learning (ML) algorithm using publicly available data to predict medical device recalls by the FDA. METHODS: We identified recalled medical devices (RMD) and non-recalled medical devices (NRMD) using the FDA's website and online database. We constructed an ML algorithm (random forest regressor) that automatically searched Google Trends and PubMed for the RMDs and NRMDs. The algorithm was trained using 400 randomly selected devices and then tested using 100 unique random devices. The algorithm output a continuous value (0-1) for recall probability for each device, which were rounded for dichotomous analysis. We determined sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for each of three time periods prior to recall (T-3, 6, or 12 months), using FDA recall status as the reference standard. The study adhered to relevant items of the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) guidelines. RESULTS: Using a rounding threshold of 0.5, sensitivities for T-3, T-6, and T-12 were 89% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69-97), 90% (95% CI 70-97), and 75% (95% CI 53-89). Specificity was 100% (95% CI 95-100) for all three time periods. Accuracy was 98% (95% CI 93-99) for T-3 and T-6, and 95% (95% CI 89-99) for T-12. Using tailored thresholds yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: An ML algorithm accurately predicted medical device recall status by the FDA with lead times as great as 12 months. Future research could incorporate longer lead times and data sources including FDA reports and prospectively test the ability of ML algorithms to predict FDA recall.",

    "Title": "Analysis of complications of minimally invasive approaches for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current treatment modalities of lumbar spinal stenosis range from conservative medical management and physical therapy to open surgical decompression. Minimally invasive lumbar decompression (MILD) and Superion interspinous spacers (SISS) Vertiflex offer the promise of effective pain relief with shorter recovery time and lesser potential complications compared with open surgical decompression procedures and general anesthesia. Despite their increasing utilization, their complication profile is not well established in the literature. METHODS: We searched the FDA's Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for all entries on MILD product code 'HRX' and SISS product code 'NQO'. MAUDE database was queried from 2010 to 2021. Duplicate entries were removed, and complications were classified based on the event descriptions. RESULTS: For the MILD procedure, a total of 10 entries were found in the MAUDE database. Among these, 8 were classified as surgical complications and 2 were device related. On the other hand, a total of 919 reports were found in the MAUDE database for Vertiflex, with 385 medical device reports were included in the analysis. Device-related were the most reported complication, accounting for 189 cases. CONCLUSION: As with any new intervention, we must proceed with caution and evaluate the procedure performance over time. Such data should aid physicians to make informed decisions before choosing either technique for their patients. The findings from this study provide insight into the complication profile associated with both MILD and Vertiflex procedures, highlighting the need for continued evaluation and careful consideration in clinical decision-making.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated with Devices for Incisional Glaucoma Surgery Performed with Implants as Reported to the FDA MAUDE Database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Incisional glaucoma surgery is indicated in advanced glaucoma or glaucoma refractory to less invasive therapies, and can be performed with implants to lower IOP including glaucoma drainage or filtration devices. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) represents the largest U.S. publicly-available repository of device-related incisional glaucoma surgery complications, enabling insight into complications experienced with incisional glaucoma surgery in real-world practice to develop a risk profile for the use of each device. METHODS: MAUDE database was searched between January-2012 and December-2021 for Brand Name: Ahmed ClearPath, Ahmed Glaucoma Valve, Baerveldt, Ex-PRESS, and Molteno. Reports were categorized by complication;when multiple were present, multiple categories were attributed. Reports with identical text and dates were counted as duplicate and excluded. Literature reports comparing multiple devices without clear device specification per complication were excluded. RESULTS: The search yielded 1538 reports, of which 1379 reports describing 2429 adverse events met inclusion criteria. The most common events for were hypotony/hypotony maculopathy (284), device-iris touch (282), device occlusion (213), elevated IOP (210), and device explanted due to possible exclusion (176). Delivery system failures occurred (166). Patients also experienced flat/shallow anterior chambers (147) and corneal edema/bullous keratopathy/endothelial cell count reduction/corneal decompensation/Descemet's membrane tears (128). CONCLUSION: By drawing on the real-world complications collected in the MAUDE database, this study identifies adverse events of greatest clinical pertinence for device-related incisional glaucoma surgery overall and by brand. Understanding the most common adverse events may support surgeons in counseling patients and preparing for device implantation.",

    "Title": "Characterizing the complication profile of spinal robotic systems: A MAUDE analysis of device failures and associated complications by device manufacturer and brand name.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pedicle screw placement in spinal surgery has evolved to incorporate increased use of technology for both preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. In recent years, robotic guidance has been used to increase the precision, accuracy, and overall patient safety of spinal column fixation via screw placement. Within this context, the present study aims to quantify and classify complications of spinal robotic devices using a nationally representative database. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) was queried for adverse events involving the most widely used spinal robotic devices from inception to November 3rd, 2023. Entries were tabulated by assigning categorical variables based on event information. RESULTS: The query yielded 339 unique robotic failure events. The most frequent complications in robotic-assisted spinal surgeries were imprecision (73.6%), software errors (13.7%), and damaged or missing screws (4.9%). Most reported events occurred intraoperatively after the initial incision (78.5%) [compared to preoperatively or postoperatively]. The Mazor X™ system was the most represented spinal robotic platform in terms of complications, accounting for 71.6% of reported robotic failure events. Most reported errors were resolved intraoperatively or continued through the employment of alternative imaging methods and, overall, had minimal clinical significance. With respect to robot-assisted pedicle screw placement, medial breaches were 1.7x more common than lateral breaches across all robotic systems. Finally, regarding the impact of device failures on perioperative timing, we found that 10.3% of adverse events resulted in delays greater than 1 h. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, imprecision and unresponsive software were found to be two of the most frequent complications of robot-assisted spine surgery.

    "Title": "Late adverse event reporting from medical device manufacturers to the US Food and Drug Administration: cross sectional study.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the extent of late adverse event reporting by manufacturers to the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer And User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database as well as the distribution of late reporting among manufacturers and associations with device characteristics. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: The FDA MAUDE database, a central postmarket safety surveillance tool for US medical devices, from 1 September 2019 to 31 December 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Medical device manufacturers that submitted initial adverse event reports to the FDA between 1 September 2019 and 31 December 2022. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time in days between date manufacturer was notified of event and date of FDA receipt of adverse event reports, proportion of reports reported late (after the required 30 day window as required by FDA regulation), and distribution of late reporting among manufacturers and medical devices. RESULTS: 13 587 reports were of deaths, 1 552 268 of injuries, and 2 866 693 of malfunctions received by the FDA from 3028 unique manufacturers and 88 448 unique medical devices in the three and a half year period. Of 4 432 548 included reports, 71.0% (n=3 146 957) of adverse events were reported within 30 days (on time), 4.5% (n=197 606) were reported between 31 and 180 days (late), and 9.1% (n=402 891) were after 180 days (late). 15.5% of reports (n=685 094) had missing or invalid date data provided by the manufacturer. Three manufactures and 13 medical devices were attributed to 54.8% of late reports. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly a third of manufacturer reports of medical device adverse events were not demonstrably submitted to the FDA within the regulatory deadline, with most late reports being submitted more than six months after manufacturer notification. Most late reports were submitted by a small number of manufacturers. Late adverse event reporting may prevent early detection of patient safety concerns.",

    "Title": "Acute Clinical Adverse Outcomes Associated With the Cor-Knot.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although an integral component of cardiac valve operations, manual knot tying has been linked with increased operative times and greater costs. The introduction of the Cor-Knot device (LSI Solutions) has eliminated hand-tied knots through an automatic titanium fastener system. However, adverse outcomes related to this device remain unknown. We thus used a nationally representative cohort to characterize adverse events of the Cor-Knot. METHODS: All adverse events for the Cor-Knot from 2015-2023 were tabulated from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. Reports were screened to assess incident type and complication. Device and patient complications were categorized and reported as proportions to further ascertain factors contributing to the development of adverse incidents. RESULTS: Of an estimated 74 adverse events, the number of reported occurrences increased over the study period from 1 in 2015 to 13 in 2023. The greatest proportion of adverse events involved the Cor-Knot Mini (41.9%) or the Cor-Knot (37.4%), with malfunction representing the most frequent device incident (63.5%). Problems related to device usage (22.8%) or misfire (22.8%) constituted the most frequent complications after Cor-Knot usage. The most frequent complications included valve insufficiency (10.8%), presence of a foreign body (8.1%), or hemorrhage (2.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Of all reported adverse events, malfunction was most likely to occur due to misfire or device usage issues. Patient complications comprised valve insufficiency, foreign body presence, or hemorrhage. As adoption and utilization of the Cor-Knot increases, future work is necessary to ensure adequate device training and minimize the incidence of adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "BackgroundAnalysis of data from incident registries such as MAUDE has identified the need to improve surveillance and maintenance strategies for infusion pumps to enhance patient and healthcare staff safety.ObjectiveThe ultimate goal is to enhance infusion pump management strategies in healthcare facilities, thus transforming the current reactive approach to infusion pump management into a proactive and predictive one.Method: This study utilized real data collected from 2015 to 2021 through the inspection of infusion pumps in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Inspections were conducted by the national laboratory in accordance with the Legal Metrology Framework, accredited to ISO 17020 standard. Out of 988 samples, 790 were used for model training, while 198 samples were set aside for validation (20% of the dataset). Various machine learning algorithms for binary classification of samples (pass/fail status) were considered, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine. These algorithms were chosen for their ability to handle large datasets and potential for high prediction accuracy.ResultsThrough detailed analysis of the achieved results, it was found that all applied machine learning methods yielded satisfactory results, with accuracy ranging from 0.98% to 1.0%, precision from 0.99% to 1%, sensitivity from 0.98% to 1.0%, and specificity from 0.87% to 1.0%. However, Decision Tree and Random Forest methods proved to be the best, both due to their maximum achieved values of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity, and due to result interpretability.ConclusionIt has been established that machine learning methods are capable of identifying potential issues before they become critical, thus playing a crucial role in predicting the performance of infusion pumps, potentially enhancing the safety, reliability, and efficiency of healthcare delivery. Further research is needed to explore the potential application of machine learning algorithms in various healthcare domains and to address practical issues related to the implementation of these algorithms in real clinical settings.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Peripheral Nerve Stimulation: An Analysis of the MAUDE Data base and Implications for Pain and Spine Clinicians.",
    "Abstract": "OF BACKGROUND DATA: The use of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) devices within pain and spine-related care has increased significantly in recent years. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for PNS have expanded rapidly with technologic advances and randomized controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy. Analysis of real-world data regarding the complications associated with PNS can help inform clinical decision-making and patient counseling as the use of this neuromodulation therapy continues to evolve. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to categorize adverse events (AEs) described in medical device reports (MDRs) within the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) data base related to the use of PNS for pain and spinal indications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search within the MAUDE data base was conducted to identify AEs related to FDA-approved PNS devices reported between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, specifically to capture AEs related to current PNS technology in clinical use. AEs were manually categorized according to event descriptions. RESULTS: We identified 594 unique MDRs associated with the five PNS devices currently approved by the FDA for use in the spine. While most MDRs (77.1%) did not specify lead location, spinal lead placements were implicated in 9.1% of cases, and appendicular lead placement accounted for 13.8%. Infection (22.7%), migration (14.7%), and skin erosion (9.4%) were the most common AEs reported. Most entries were categorized as device-related (40.1%) or procedural AEs (32.7%), and the remainder as patient complaints (17.3%), serious AEs (1.0%), and \"other\" complications (6.1%). Most complications were managed with explantations (43.8%) rather than revisions (29.5%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: New technologies and their applications must be regularly evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Our analysis of the MAUDE data base revealed that infection, lead migration, and skin erosion were the most commonly reported AEs associated with the use of PNS technology during 2023. Most AEs were deemed to be device- or procedure-related.",

    "Abstract": "Interest in using the MAUDE database to investigate adverse events linked to medical devices has been growing. Yet, the narrative sections of these reports remain largely unexplored, leaving valuable insights unutilized and creating an incomplete understanding of these events. To bridge this gap, we employ large language models (LLMs) to analyze and interpret these narratives. Using OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo model, we focused on MAUDE reports involving endoscopic clips to identify uncoded surgical procedures and uncover additional insights. This approach showcases the potential of LLMs in processing narrative content, offering a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to previous methods and supporting the translation of MAUDE reports into actionable knowledge for clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect are among the most common congenital heart diseases. When they are symptomatic, either pharmacologic or percutaneous/surgical treatment should be considered. The aim of this study was to investigate the post-approval complication profiles of the Gore Cardioform and Gore Helex devices based on the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database. METHODS: A search of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database was performed to identify reports of complications following the closure of atrial septal defects with Gore devices. 401 reports met inclusion criteria, including 204 patients with Gore Cardioform Septal Occluder, 146 patients with Gore Cardioform ASD Occluder, and 51 patients with Gore Helex Septal Occluder. RESULTS: The number of adverse events related to device problems contributed to 51.4 % of reported complications (n = 206), which mostly consisted of embolism of the device (n = 140). There were 3 reported cases of death, with 2 linked to device embolization. Most reports concerned devices sized 25 and 30 mm although only 313 reports (78.1 %) had information about size available. 54 cases of pericardial effusion and 14 cases of perforation were reported. Multiple postoperative arrhythmias were reported (n = 80), with the majority of them being atrial fibrillation (n = 39) or heart block (n = 18). CONCLUSIONS: No cardiac erosions linked to Gore devices were found throughout our analysis, supporting earlier literature findings. The investigated devices and their sizes varied in terms of complication profiles.",

    "Title": "Adverse Events Associated With Ultrasonic Bone Saws.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To classify device- and patient-related events associated with the use of ultrasonic bone saws. METHODS: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried for medical device reports from January 2014 through June 2024. The search included the following terms: \"piezo saw,\" \"piezoelectric,\" \"piezosurgery,\" and \"sonopet.\" Medical device reports for Piezosurgery (Mectron, Carasco, Italy) and Sonopet Ultrasonic Bone Aspirator (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) were analyzed and data extracted. RESULTS: In total, 673 reports were reviewed and 432 were included for analysis, 64 and 368 of which involved Piezosurgery and Sonopet, respectively. The most common device-related events were inability to irrigate (n = 186), overheating or melting of the device (n = 148), and fracture of the insert tip (n = 58). Due to malfunctions, 18 clinically significant case delays and 1 case abortion were reported. Patient-related events occurred in 31 cases, resulting in 15 morbidities. The most common patient injury was thermal burn (n = 13) followed by iatrogenic foreign body (n = 8). Patient-related events resulted in conservative treatment in 10 cases and further surgical intervention in 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonic bone saws are used increasingly in place of oscillating saws and conventional osteotomies for craniomaxillofacial and rhinoplasty surgery. Understanding the risks of device overheating or fracture, and the associated risk of thermal burn or iatrogenic foreign body may help surgeons improve the safe use of these devices.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate, describe, and compare adverse event reports (AERs) and their patterns amongst commonly used operative hysteroscopy devices. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) published by the Food and Drug Administration. SETTING: N/A PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Women who underwent hysteroscopic surgery, with adverse events reported to MAUDE. INTERVENTIONS: Search terms within the MAUDE database included \"resectoscope,\" \"hysteroscopic reciprocating morcellator,\" \"MyoSure,\" and \"TruClear.\" Reports were categorized by device type, patient complications, and required interventions. Statistical analysis utilized Fisher's exact tests. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Between January 2014 and April 2024, 1,872 AERs were identified for hysteroscopes: 664 for resectoscopes and 1,208 for morcellation devices (MyoSure, N=645 and TruClear, N=563).While absolute complication rates are not able to calculated from MAUDE, there were significant differences in the reporting of patient complications: resectoscope devices had higher frequency of infection (p<0.01) while morcellation devices had higher frequency reporting of hemorrhage (p<0.001), uterine perforation (p<0.001), and bowel perforation (p<0.001). Morcellation device AERs more often reported operative intervention (1.1% versus 12.4%, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis comparing AERs of morcellation devices showed the majority (73.2%) of TruClear AERs registered no patient impact or harm, while only 21.2% of MyoSure AERs reported no patient impact. MyoSure device AERs had higher frequency of hemorrhage (p<0.001), infections (p<0.001), uterine perforations (p<0.001), and bowel perforations (p<0.001). Additionally, MyoSure AERs reported more surgical intervention compared to TruClear AEs (19.5% versus 4.3%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While conclusions within the MAUDE database are limited, especially given the lack of data concerning the volume of surgeries done with each device and the voluntary reporting mechanism, there are significant differences in the types of adverse events reported among operative hysteroscopy instruments. Morcellation AERs had a significantly higher frequency of patient complications and described more surgical interventions compared to AERs for resectoscopes. When comparing MyoSure and TruClear, MyoSure AERs described a significantly greater proportion of serious patient complications compared to TruClear device AERs. Devices with similar functions may differ in how stakeholders report complications.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Impella 5.5 is increasingly being used in patients with cardiogenic shock, but experience with the device remains limited, and severe complications, including death, have been reported. This study aims to investigate causes of Impella 5.5-related deaths. METHODS: Data were extracted from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database using the search term \"Impella 5.5\" with the outcome \"death.\" Case details were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: A total of 47 cases were reviewed. Of these, four cases were excluded as unrelated to the device. Among the 43 cases included, 40 involved either procedural-related or device-related complications. The remaining three cases had an indeterminant cause. Procedural complications were observed in 26 cases (61%). Of these, 16 cases (37%) involved cardiac perforation, which was frequently caused by improper placement or re-positioning of the device. Five cases (12%) involved graft/vessel-related complications, including bleeding, detachment from the aorta, or dissection, which were linked to technical difficulties during insertion or suturing. The remaining five cases (12%) involved valve damage or device malposition. Device-related complications were reported in 14 cases (33%). Of these, eight cases (19%) were device malfunctions including pump stoppage due to issues such as electrical failure, biomaterial ingestion, or lumen damage. Six patients (14%) experienced device-related clot formation and/or stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac perforation emerged as the most frequent complication associated with Impella 5.5-related deaths, followed by device malfunction. These findings highlight the need for improved operational techniques, better device reliability, and refined safety protocols for Impella 5.5 usage.",

    "Abstract": "Research utilizing the open-access MAUDE database frequently reveals unclear methodologies for extracting and processing medical device report (MDR) data, reducing reproducibility and consistency. By harnessing the OpenFDA API and our MAUDE extract-transform-load (ETL) pipeline that standardizes the extraction and transformation of MDR data, this project explores how a large language model (LLM) can be employed to analyze free-text narratives in MDRs, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of event categorization. The ETL-LLM approach is demonstrated through MDRs related to endoscopic mucosal resection, with potential applications extending to other devices and patient issues. Additional efforts are necessary to expand the size and diversity of the MDR sample to improve data-driven patient safety research.",

We focus on the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database-the FDA's central tool for tracking the safety of marketed AI/ML devices. In particular, we evaluate the data pertaining to adverse events associated with approximately 950 medical devices incorporating AI/ML functions for devices approved between 2010 through 2023, and we find that the existing system is insufficient for properly assessing the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML devices. In particular, we make three contributions: (1) characterize the adverse event reports for such devices, (2) examine the ways in which the existing FDA adverse reporting system for medical devices falls short, and (3) suggest changes FDA might consider in its approach to adverse event reporting for devices incorporating AI/ML functions.",

    "Title": "Prevalence and root causes of operating room fires in the United States 2014-2024.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Operating room fires, though rare, pose serious risks to patient and operator safety. Among the known ignition sources, light-emitting surgical devices-including fiberoptic cables, headlamps, and light boxes-are increasingly recognized contributors. However, the true prevalence and underlying causes remain under-characterized in national surveillance data. This study hypothesized that operator error is a leading cause of light-source-related fires and sought to identify specific device types, procedural timing, and preventable risk factors involved in these adverse events. METHODS: Reports from the U.S. FDA's MAUDE database were analyzed for light source-related operating room fires from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. Events were categorized by device type, procedural timing, root cause, and resultant injury. RESULTS: A total of 45 adverse events were analyzed. Most fires were associated with light sources (33.3%), light headlamps (31.1%), and fiberoptic cables (20%). Intraoperative fires comprised the majority (35.6%). Operator error accounted for 37.8% of cases, with common errors including device mishandling (35.2%) and failure to detect damage (17.6%). Only 13.3% required intra-procedural interventions; injuries included one patient burn and two operator injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Most operating room fires involving light sources were linked to modifiable operator errors. These findings underscore the urgent need for preventive strategies-including mandatory training, regular equipment checks, and improved design standards-to reduce intraoperative fire risk and enhance surgical safety.",

    "Title": "Postmarket Safety Surveillance of FDA-Cleared Prescription Digital Therapeutics Using the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database: A Pharmacovigilance Study.",
    "Abstract": "Background and aim Prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs) are software-based medical treatments authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a range of chronic conditions. As clinical adoption increases, postmarket surveillance becomes essential to ensure safety beyond controlled trial environments. This study aimed to characterize postmarket adverse events and product problems associated with FDA-cleared PDTs using data from the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. This approach supports the generation of hypothesis-forming safety signals in naturalistic care settings, where adherence patterns, off-label use, and user variability are more likely to emerge. Methods We conducted a retrospective, pharmacovigilance study of the MAUDE database through April 30, 2025. Device-specific product codes were used to identify reports related to 13 FDA-cleared PDTs as follows: reSET (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for substance use disorder, reSET-O (Middletown, CT: PursueCare) for opioid use disorder, Somryst (Alpharetta, GA: Nox Health) and SleepioRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for chronic insomnia, EndeavorRx (Boston, MA: Akili, Inc.) for pediatric attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parallel (San Francisco, CA: Mahana Therapeutics Inc.) and Regulora (Chicago, IL: metaMe Health) for irritable bowel syndrome, Stanza (San Francisco, CA: Swing Therapeutics, Inc.) for fibromyalgia, AspyreRx (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for type-2 diabetes, Rejoyn (Princeton, NJ: Otsuka Precision Health, Inc.) for major depressive disorder, DaylightRx (San Francisco, CA: Big Health) for generalized anxiety disorder, MamaLift Plus (Princeton, NJ: Curio Digital Therapeutics) for postpartum depression, and CT-132 (New York City, NY: Click Therapeutics, Inc.) for episodic migraine. Each report was manually reviewed for relevance and data extracted on event type, patient demographics, outcomes, and product details. Results Four reports were initially identified. Two were excluded after verification that they involved non-cleared or over-the-counter digital products. Of the remaining two, one report involved Somryst for insomnia prescribed to a patient with a seizure disorder, a known contraindication listed in its labeling, and resulted in disability. The other involved EndeavorRx, which reported perceived ineffectiveness without clinical harm. No adverse events were identified for the remaining 11 PDTs. Conclusions In this study, only two adverse event reports associated with FDA-cleared PDTs were identified in the MAUDE database. While this may suggest a favorable safety profile, the findings must be interpreted with caution given the limitations of passive surveillance systems, including underreporting, reporting bias, and limited capacity to capture software-specific harms. These preliminary results highlight the need for modernized, active safety monitoring frameworks tailored to the unique risks of digital therapeutics.",

    "Title": "Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation Respiratory Lead Migration: MAUDE Database Review and Case Report.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Unilateral hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HGNS) to treat obstructive sleep apnea involves implantation of a pulse generator, a respiratory sensing lead, and a stimulation lead. Complications may arise related to all components. Previous studies have presented the overall incidence of reported adverse events. The objective of this study was to provide an updated report of complications from the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, with a focus on the respiratory sensing lead, and propose a care algorithm with two cases of sensing lead migration. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study, case report. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: The MAUDE database was queried for events related to the HGNS respiratory sensing lead from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2022. Primary outcomes were respiratory lead migration resulting in pneumothorax or need for revision surgery/explantation. RESULTS: In total, 151 out of 765 HGNS adverse events were related to the respiratory sensing lead, and of those, 75 were related to lead migration. There were seven events related to migration of the sensing lead into the pleural space, of which six cases underwent revision surgery (<1% of adverse events reported related to HGNS). Two cases noted pneumothorax due to sensing lead migration. We report two cases of sensing lead migration at our institution. Migration was demonstrated with serial imaging. These cases highlight the potential need for preoperative or intraoperative chest tube placement, based on the extent of migration, complications, and complexity. CONCLUSION: Migration of the respiratory sensing lead is a rare event with multidisciplinary surgical planning considerations.",

    "Title": "Adjustable continence therapy for men (ProACTTM): systematic review and compendium of adverse events.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adjustable continence therapy for men (ProACTTM) is an inflatable para-urethral balloon approved for consumer use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015. Post-approval adverse events (AEs) have been catalogued in Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE). To characterize the complication profile of the device, we systematically reviewed all publications and MAUDE narratives outlining AEs related to ProACTTM. METHODS: Thirty-one peer-reviewed publications studying ProACTTM implantation in humans were identified by search of PubMed and Google Scholar using combination of keywords \"ProACT\", \"balloon\", and \"continence\". Eleven studies were excluded. The MAUDE database was searched for reports of AEs related to the placement of ProACTTM and narratives of AEs were characterized. RESULTS: Of 1,607 patients treated in published studies, 752 AEs occurred. The most common were mechanical failure (n=224, 30%), device migration/malposition (n=155, 21%), and device erosion (n=120, 16%). Devices were explanted in 24% of patients and revised or reimplanted in 28% of cases. In the MAUDE database, the AEs identified were similar, with most common complications including device erosion (n=32, 49%), surgical site infection (n=15, 19%), and urinary retention (n=9, 11%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ProACTTM device is associated with a high rate of AEs. Limitations include the lack of clinical details in the MAUDE database.",

    "Abstract": "The increased dependence on patient safety studies using the MAUDE database underscores the critical need to define and standardize the methods for extracting and analyzing event reports. The lack of reproducible methods leads to an inconsistent understanding of reported events and diminishes their effectiveness in informing clinicians. Thus, an ETL pipeline combined with LLMs was proposed to standardize the identification and interpretation of the reports. Using endoscopic clip reports as an example, the ETL-LLM method demonstrates the effectiveness of extracting and analyzing categorical and narrative reports, helping uncover insights related to patient complications, surgical procedures, and device uses. This innovative and transparent method of examining MAUDE underscores its potential to inform clinicians promptly and encourages more research on patient safety through open-access databases.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Robotic spine surgery has experienced substantial market growth with global projections exceeding $1.2 billion by 2026. Manufacturers prominently promote enhanced screw placement accuracy, reduced radiation exposure, and improved surgical efficiency as primary value propositions. PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive economic analyses incorporating the impact of adverse events on manufacturer claimed benefits. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study PATIENT SAMPLE: This study included 1346 robotic spine surgery adverse events (812 MazorX and 534 Globus Excelsius) reported to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from 2016 to 2025. OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse event characterizations and procedural delay METHODS: Using a structured extraction methodology, we quantified procedural time impacts, workflow modifications, and resource utilization requirements associated with robotic complications. These measured parameters were subsequently incorporated into an economic model evaluating financial viability across 189 scenarios with varied operating room costs, annual case volumes, and complication rates. RESULTS: Adverse events resulted in a mean procedural delay of 58.1 minutes (95% CI, 54.7-61.5 minutes), with significant variation between robotic systems (Globus: 88.5 minutes vs MazorX: 45.3 minutes; P<.001). Precision issues, despite representing the central marketing claim of robotic technology, constituted 66.4% of reported complications. Robot abandonment occurred in 34.4% of cases, resulting in significantly longer delays (71.4 vs 44.8 minutes; P<.001). Economic analysis incorporating these measured disruptions demonstrated that none of the 189 modeled scenarios achieved financial breakeven within the systems' 7-year useful life, with even optimal conditions requiring 33.8 years to recover initial investment costs. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a disconnect between the marketed efficiency of robotic spine surgery and its observed economic and clinical realities. The increased procedural delays and predominance of precision-related adverse events suggest that current robotic platforms may require further refinement to align more closely with the operational needs of surgeons and the fiscal priorities of healthcare systems striving to balance innovation, quality, and value.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To analyze adverse events and failures associated with lacrimal stents, intubation sets, and balloon catheters using reports from the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database over a decade. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 86 medical device reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between May 27, 2014 and February 24, 2024. Data on adverse events, device types, and patient demographics were extracted. Descriptive statistics summarized the frequency and types of events. RESULTS: A total of 86 device-related and 46 patient-related adverse events were reported. Among the patient-related events, 43 involved foreign body retention, 2 involved bloody tears, and one of slight bleeding. Regarding device-related events, 73.3% were tube-related, with the most common issues being tube penetration due to a missing stainless-steel ring (38.4%), followed by tube tip breakage (8.1%) and leaks (7%). Issues with the dilation process comprised 5.8%. Balloon-related problems, primarily balloon tears (10.5%), accounted for 20.9% of device-related events. The reports revealed demographic gaps, with complete patient information available in less than half of the cases. The findings highlight recurrent failure modes linked to specific device brands and insertion techniques. CONCLUSION: This study offers a comprehensive overview of failure scenarios and associated risk factors for lacrimal stents, intubation sets, and balloon catheters. Detailing adverse events and device-specific issues, it aims to assist clinicians in anticipating potential complications and improving management strategies. Enhanced reporting and rigorous postmarket surveillance are crucial to further optimize device safety and effectiveness.",

    "Title": "Pediatric Complications of Automated Tympanostomy Tube Systems: MAUDE Analysis and Systematic Review.",
    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates complications associated with automated tympanostomy tube delivery systems (TDS) in pediatric patients through a systematic review and analysis of the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and MAUDE. METHODS: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines identified studies on automated TDS, while the MAUDE database was queried using the product class \"tympanostomy tube delivery system with drug\" and relevant manufacturers. Primary outcomes included intra- and post-procedural complications, while secondary outcomes assessed procedural success and escalation to general anesthesia (GA) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in the operating room (OR). RESULTS: Intraprocedural complications occurred in 8.2% of cases. The most frequently cited complication in the literature was excessive movement or behavioral intolerance (56%), while inadequate anesthesia (38%) was the leading intraprocedural issue in MAUDE reports. The average procedural success rate was 91%, with 3.2% requiring OR escalation. Postprocedural complications occurred in 33% of cases, with tube occlusion (36%) and reluctance to undergo ear examinations (30%) as the most common short-term events. Long-term complications included otitis media with otorrhea (32%) and otitis media (25%). CONCLUSION: While TDS were designed to streamline in-office care, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to challenges in achieving adequate immobility and anesthesia in awake pediatric patients. Although complication rates appear comparable to traditional tympanostomy tubes, some reports highlight concerns regarding procedural distress. Further research is needed to refine patient selection, optimize anesthesia protocols, and assess long-term outcomes to determine their role in pediatric otolaryngology. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.",

    "Title": "Rates of Osteolysis for Commercially Available Cervical Disc Arthroplasty Devices in the United States: A Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database Analysis.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) represents a promising alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for the treatment of symptomatic degenerative disc disease in appropriately selected patients. It offers the potential benefits of motion preservation and reduced adjacent segment degeneration. However, like any surgical procedure, CDA has associated risks and complications. Among these, postoperative osteolysis, although rare, warrants further investigation to fully understand its incidence, causes, and optimal management strategies. This study's purpose is to elucidate the current incidence of osteolysis following CDA. METHODS: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was queried using the \"Brand Name\" function for: \"Mobi C,\" \"Mobi-C,\" \"Prodisc -C,\" \"Prodisc C,\" \"Bryan,\" \"PCM,\" \"Secure-C,\" \"Secure C,\" \"Prestige,\" \"M6,\" and \"Simplify\" from 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2024. Search results were further queried for the word \"osteolysis.\" Osteolysis percentage was calculated as a proportion of a total number of valid reports. The findings from this study were compared with published literature. RESULTS: The total number of osteolysis events reported in the MAUDE database for each disc was 2 Mobi-C, 1 Prodisc-C, 3 Bryan, 0 PCM, 0 Secure-C, 2 Prestige, 138 M6, and 16 Simplify. The highest rate of osteolysis was found in the M6 (36.2%) and Simplify discs (25.8%). Results from the MAUDE database were consistent with previously published literature. CONCLUSION: While acknowledging the limitations of the MAUDE database, the data presented give rise to substantial concerns regarding the association of osteolysis with the M6 implant. While the reports on the Simplify disc are recent, the current findings indicate a necessity for careful monitoring. Although surgeon participation in the MAUDE database is optional, it is imperative to promptly report any issues with recent technology to ensure fellow surgeons and the public are well informed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This report brings to light a clinical concern of osteolysis in cervical TDR surgeries that was not previously discussed. Using these findings, surgeons can look out for signs of osteolysis in earlier follow-up to provide early treatment.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sphincterotomes are widely used during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for duct cannulation and sphincterotomy. ERCP can be associated with various adverse events (AEs); however, those associated with sphincterotome device problems are not well known. We aim to analyze device problems and patient-related AEs associated with sphincterotomes using the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: After a comprehensive search, we analyzed the post-marketing surveillance data for sphincterotomes from the FDA's MAUDE database to report device-related deaths, injuries, and modes of failure from January 2014 to September 2024. Data related to manufacturers, device problems, and patient outcomes was collected, and descriptive statistics were performed to summarize findings. Report trends over time analysis was also performed. RESULTS: 3909 reports of events related to sphincterotome use were found through September 2024. Total reports by major manufacturers include Boston Scientific (Natick, MA, USA): 44% (1721/3909), Cook Endoscopy (Winston Salem, NC, USA): 22.7% (887/3909), and Olympus (Center Valley, PA, USA): 33.3% 1301/3909. The most common event was malfunction in 94.7% (3701/3909) followed by injury in 5.1% (200/3909) and death in 0.2% (8/3909). The most common device problem was break in 59.8% (2339/3909). A total of 248 patient-related AEs were identified with the most common being foreign body in patients (n = 61, 24.6%) followed by hemorrhage (n = 55, 22.2%), perforation (n = 44, 16.5%), and pancreatitis (n = 40, 16.1%). There was a positive trend of reports years between 2014 and 2021 with p < 0.001. CONCLUSION: Based on post-marketing surveillance data from the FDA's MAUDE database, our analysis of sphincterotome reports suggests that mechanical failure, particularly device breakage is the most prevalent device problem, and foreign body was the most common patient-related AE. While reported adverse events appear to increase over time, this may reflect increased sphincterotome utilization/procedure volume or reporting vigilance rather than true increases in device-related complications.",

    "Title": "Investigating complications of extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) in the food and drug administration manufacturer and user facility device experience database.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The extreme lateral interbody fusion (XLIF) approach is being increasingly adopted to alleviate complications that are commonplace with other approaches; however, an analysis of the device malfunctions and patient injuries associated with the procedure was not available. The purpose of this study was to search the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE) for medical device reports (MDRs) associated with the XLIF procedure and categorically analyze the device and patient complications. METHODS: MDRs from Jan. 2012 to Nov. 2022 from the MAUDE database regarding the XLIF procedure were filtered and analyzed by two independent reviewers. The complications associated with each MDR were then categorized into device malfunctions and patient injuries, further reclassified into intra-operative and post-operative complications, and analyzed for their relative frequencies. RESULTS: The most common intra-operative device malfunction was the fracture of an instrument other than the interbody/cage at 8.1% (25/308) and the least common intra-operative device malfunction was an inability to insert the interbody/cage at 3.6% (11/308). The most common post-operative device malfunction was migration of something other than the cage at 5.2% (16/208) and the least common was cage migration at 2.3% (7/208). Post-operative wound issues were the most common patient injury at 7.3% (23/314) and the least common injuries included intra-operative paralysis and intra-operative death at 0.6% (2/314). CONCLUSION: Although the XLIF procedure was developed to mitigate vascular injury, the predominant complication continues to be vascular injury, followed by organ injury based on MDRs submitted to the MAUDE database. This study provides an extensive search into the device malfunctions and patient injuries specific to the XLIF procedure, which has not been studied before. Such analysis provides a valuable focus for manufacturers and surgeons to improve patient safety by refining device design and optimizing surgical techniques.",

    "Title": "Adverse events associated with Implantable Collamer Lens: insights from the FDA MAUDE database.",
    "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) implantation is rising globally, yet real-world studies on adverse events (AEs) remain scarce. This study analyses ICL-related complications using the MAUDE database. METHODS: Data on ICL-related AEs were extracted from the MAUDE database. Cases were categorized into spherical and toric ICLs based on lens diopter. Descriptive statistics summarized device-related issues and complications, and Cramér's V assessed their associations. Management strategies and resolution rates for common complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: Among 25,001 ICL-related AEs, 43.8% involved spherical ICLs and 56.2% toric ICLs. Common device-related issues included \"Shape and/or size problems\" (nearly half of annual AEs) and \"Off-label use\" (around 20%, rising since 2019 and stabilizing). \"Operation and control issues\" declined steadily since 2019, stabilizing below 3%. Spherical ICL cases with \"Activation, positioning, or separation problems\" dropped below 1% post-2019, while toric cases remained at 6.9-9.0%. The top three complications-\"Vision issues,\" \"Intraocular pressure issues\" and \"Lens-related issues\"-were most frequent, with \"No patient impact\" in most cases. Moderate correlations were found between complications and ICL-related AEs (p = 9.999 × 10-5, Cramér's V: 0.47 for spherical, 0.45 for toric). Management strategies, including lens exchange and lens extraction followed by surgery, demonstrated high resolution rates. CONCLUSION: While ICL implantation is generally safe, concerns about inappropriate sizing and off-label use persist. This study suggests that improving lens sizing accuracy and adhering to guidelines may reduce AEs.",

To meet the challenges, AutoQUEST, a Python-based prompt pipeline that capitalizes on large language models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been proposed to facilitate the automation of question formulation. In five distinct test cases, AutoQUEST yielded an accuracy rate of 100% in generating valid research questions and attained query execution success rates ranging from 75% to 100%. This innovative CoT pipeline facilitates the research question formulating process, reduces technical barriers in data extraction and transformation, and enhances the efficacy of patient safety research concerning medical devices.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) represent a novel treatment option for coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR). The AGENT DCB (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) demonstrated superior efficacy in treating ISR compared to uncoated balloons in randomized controlled trials. However, real-world data on AGENT DCB safety remains limited. AIMS: This study sought out to evaluate post-marketing adverse event reports related to the AGENT DCB. METHODS: This study analyzed post-marketing adverse event reports submitted to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database between March 1, 2024, and March 1, 2025, specifically focusing on coronary interventions utilizing the AGENT DCB. Reports were independently reviewed and categorized by device-related complications, patient injuries, and device failures. Data were summarized descriptively, and limitations inherent to the MAUDE database were considered. RESULTS: After screening and excluding duplicates, 155 reports on the AGENT DCB were included. Among all reports, device malfunctions without injury were most common (56.77%), followed by patient injury (30.97%) and death (12.26%). Of the total reported device problems, balloon rupture (33.55%) and shaft breakage (10.32%) were predominant. Injuries reported included angina (32.84%), acute myocardial infarction (29.85%), and coronary perforation (8.95%). Notably, 30 MAUDE reports described off-label treatment of de novo lesions; these off-label cases exhibited similar injury rates compared to ISR-treated lesions (53.33% vs. 57.89%). CONCLUSION: Real-world analysis of FDA MAUDE reports revealed frequent device malfunctions, mainly balloon rupture and shaft breakage, and patient complications such as angina, myocardial infarction, and coronary perforation. The off-label use for de novo lesions highlights the need for caution and further clinical investigation.",

    "Title": "Blurred vision, clear concern: linking poor visualization with adverse events in minimally invasive surgery.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: While minimally invasive surgery (MIS) offers numerous benefits, ensuring patient safety remains paramount. This study examines the critical role of visualization in MIS safety by analyzing visualization-related adverse events reported in the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: We implemented a systematic search strategy within the MAUDE database using 165 unique three-word search phrases to capture a broad range of visualization challenges encountered during procedures. RESULTS: Our analysis of over 12,000 MAUDE reports from 2014 to 2024 reveals a concerning prevalence of such challenges in laparoscopic surgery. A striking 72% of these reports were linked to patient injury, highlighting a strong association between suboptimal visualization and adverse outcomes. Further analysis revealed that over half of the specific visualization-related keywords examined were associated with adverse events resulting in patient injury rates exceeding 50%, indicating a high likelihood of harm when these challenges occur. The potential for significant underreporting in MAUDE suggests the true incidence rate could be drastically higher, potentially affecting over 120,000 patients annually. While reports associated with keywords linked to robotic surgery were considerably fewer in number, the proportion of those linked to patient injury was higher in robotic reports, emphasizing the persistent need for vigilance regarding visualization even with advanced surgical platforms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the urgent need for a critical reassessment of the current standard of care for visualization in MIS. Further research is crucial to explore potential causal relationships between suboptimal visualization and patient injury and to develop effective strategies to mitigate these risks, ultimately enhancing patient safety and optimizing surgical outcomes.",

    "Title": "Real-World Safety Profile of EVO and EVO+ Implantable Collamer Lenses: A Retrospective Study Based on FDA Surveillance Data.",
    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To evaluate and characterize adverse events (AEs) associated with EVO and EVO+ implantable collamer lens (ICL) using real-world post-marketing surveillance data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s MAUDE database. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on AE reports related to EVO and EVO+ ICLs, including both spherical and toric models, submitted between 2015 and 2023. After excluding duplicate entries and incomplete records, reports were stratified by lens model and optical type into four groups: spherical EVO, toric EVO, spherical EVO+, and toric EVO+. Each report was independently reviewed by two senior ophthalmologists to classify the associated complications. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the proportional distribution of complications across subgroups and to assess the annual trend in reported AEs. RESULTS: A total of 17,482 AEs reports were analyzed. Across all subgroups, over half of the reports documented no clinical signs or symptoms. Blurred vision was the most frequently reported visual complaint, with a relatively higher reporting frequency in the EVO+ groups. Events involving elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma were more commonly reported among EVO+ recipients. In addition, a number of rare but clinically significant complications were documented, including hemorrhage, hyphema, decreased intraocular pressure, endophthalmitis, and toxic anterior segment syndrome. The annual number of reported AEs showed a consistent upward trend throughout the study period. CONCLUSION: This real-world data analysis provides insights into the distribution of major complications associated with ICL implantation in clinical practice. Comprehensive identification and reporting of rare adverse outcomes may help surgeons broaden their perspectives, enhance surgical preparedness, and provide more personalized and informed preoperative counseling.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal ablation technique using high-voltage, low-energy pulses to induce cell membrane perforation and cell death. As an emerging therapy, IRE has gained increasing application in local tumor treatment, with Nanoknife being the most widely used device. Despite its relative safety compared to traditional therapies, potential adverse reactions still merit the attention of clinicians. METHODS: We analyzed all IRE-related adverse event reports in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database, focusing on event types, Clavien-Dindo Grades, the timing of adverse events and temporal trends across cancers. RESULTS: Device malfunctions with Nanoknife were a significant issue but have declined recently. In pancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal injuries (mainly hemorrhagic lesions) were most commonly reported. In liver cancer, arrhythmias were frequent, with no new cases in recent years. In prostate cancer, rectal fistula was the most common adverse event, with an increasing number of cases being reported. CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, the Nanoknife is expected to exhibit favorable safety profiles. However, ongoing attention to device maintenance, treatment standardization, and postoperative management is needed to further enhance its safety.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Real life data on adverse events of penile prosthesis are lacking. Aim of this study is to summarize medical device reports (MDRs) related to penile prosthesis implants within the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database held by The Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: We examined all MDRs from MAUDE database reported in the last ten years related to each FDA-approved penile implant. Event descriptions were reviewed and classified into specific event types. Outcome measures included specific penile prosthesis and reported events as detailed by the MDRs. All data is in line with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Pooled Relative risk was used to compare data. RESULTS: Overall, in 10 years, 1340 reports were sent, with the highest number of events reported between 2019 and 2022. Overall, 1240/1340 (92%) were reported as injury while 91/1340 (7%) as implant malfunction. Infection (181/1340: 14%), Erosion (144/1340: 11%), Pain (68/1340: 5%) and Perforation (47/1340: 4%) were the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs). In terms of manufacturer: 675/1340 (50%) were from Boston Scientific, 198/1340 (15%) were Coloplast and 463/1340 (35%) were AMS. When comparing different producers on disproportional analysis, Coloplast presented a higher risk of infection when compared to Boston Scientific and AMS (PRR= 1.5-2.62; P<0.05). Perforation, pain, failure to implant and erosion incidence were comparable between manufacturers. CONCLUSIONS: According to MAUDE database, the most frequent complications related to penile prosthesis are infections, erosions, pain, and perforation. Coloplast prosthesis seem to be associated with a higher risk of infection.",

    "Abstract": "STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the failure patterns of expandable corpectomy cages. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Expandable corpectomy cages offer significant advantages for anterior column reconstruction but introduce unique mechanical complexities. Device-specific failure patterns and their clinical implications remain poorly characterized in the literature. METHODS: We analyzed 373 adverse event reports involving expandable corpectomy cages from the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database through October 2024. Using validated AI-assisted classification, reports were categorized by failure mode, anatomical location, revision status, and contributing factors. Chi-square tests with Bonferroni correction were used to assess associations between variables. RESULTS: Inserter-related issues constituted the most common adverse events (34.3%), yet rarely resulted in clinical symptoms (5.4%) or revision surgery (21.9%). Conversely, less frequent mechanical failures demonstrated significantly higher revision rates: endplate subsidence (80.0%), device migration (77.8%), and structural fracture (63.8%). Failure modes showed distinct anatomical patterns, with migration predominating in the lumbar spine (31.4% vs. 2.3% cervical), while height loss occurred more frequently in cervical applications (20.5% vs. 7.8% lumbar). Among inserter issues, torque handle calibration failures (18.8%) and set screw complications (25.0%) accounted for nearly half of these events. Surgical technique was identified as the predominant contributing factor across all failure modes (28.7%), while inadequate fixation was specifically associated with device migration (35.6% of migration cases). CONCLUSION: For surgeons, the high reported prevalence of inserter complications may be a key consideration for device selection, particularly regarding set screw mechanisms, despite the apparent lesser clinical impact. Similarly, heightened vigilance may be warranted for lumbar applications of expandable corpectomy cages due to increased migration risk.",

    "Title": "An Analysis of Adverse Events Associated with Mandibular Repositioning Appliances (MRA)- Study of the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database.",
    "Abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Mandibular repositioning appliances (MRAs) are widely used for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring, but their safety profile remains underexplored. This study analyzes adverse events associated with MRAs using the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: A retrospective review of the MAUDE database identified adverse events related to MRAs under the product code \"LRK\" from January 1, 2015, to February 8, 2025. Reports were categorized into seven groups: allergic reactions, broken parts, loose screws, dental issues, ill-fitted appliances, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, and miscellaneous issues. Duplicate reports and unrelated cases were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 517 reports were analyzed, with allergic reactions (40.3%) and device breakage (39.4%) being the most frequently reported issues. Other events included loose screws (6.3%), dental issues (3.5%), ill-fitting appliances (3.3%), TMJ problems (2.9%), and miscellaneous complaints (3.3%). Custom-made MRAs were involved in 85% of cases, while boil-and-bite devices accounted for 15%. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the MAUDE database reveals an increasing number of adverse event reports related to MRAs, reflecting their growing use in treating OSA and snoring. Outcomes and success depend on factors like device type, patient selection, and adherence. Adverse events such as allergic reactions and device breakage highlight the need for proper material selection and maintenance, favoring MRAs made from biocompatible materials over polymethyl methacrylate or metal. MRAs also present limitations such as dental contraindications and occlusal changes, stressing the importance of patient monitoring. Future research should focus on prospective studies to better assess outcomes.",

    "Title": "Safety of a pacemaker mode intended to protect patients.",
    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2021, Boston Scientific (BSC) announced that its Ingenio pacemakers (PMs) could exhibit high internal battery impedances (HIBIs) and trigger the safety mode (SM) that should preserve pacing when PM function is jeopardized. SM is VVI or biventricular pacing, 72.5 bpm, and unipolar, with a sensitivity of 0.25 mV. In 2023, BSC said SM may pause pacing and 3 deaths occurred in PM-dependent patients. In 2024, BSC warned that some Accolade PMs had HIBI and SM could occur. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify adverse events (AEs) associated with SM and compare them with Abbott's backup (BU), Medtronic's reset (RE), and Biotronik's backup mode. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was searched from 2021 to 2024 for AE involving SM, BU, RE, and backup mode. RESULTS: We found 1379 AEs, including 13 deaths and 574 major AEs; 525 AEs (91.5%) were PMs in SM vs 31 (5.4%) in BU, 18 (3.1%) in RE, and none (P < .001) in backup mode. SM was associated with 349 syncopal events that resulted in head injuries (n = 25) or falls (n = 20); BU- or RE-related syncopal events resulted in 1 head injury and no falls (P < .001). Pacing inhibition was described for 204 SM-related syncopal events (58.%) but none for BU or RE. HIBI was the most common but not an exclusive cause of SM. CONCLUSION: SM is associated with major AEs that are more numerous and serious than BU, RE, or backup mode. Most SM AEs seem related to its high sensitivity (0.25 mV), and consequently, SM may be unsafe for PM-dependent patients.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) is a critical tool in the evaluation of small bowel bleeding, detection of small bowel neoplasms and diagnosing Crohn's disease. The object of this study was to examine device failures (DF) and patient-related adverse events (PRAE) in SBCE, including those involving the patency capsule system, using user-generated reports from the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHOD: We analyzed post marketing surveillance data for SBCE data for all of the SBCE systems from the FDA's MAUDE database from January 2000 until December 2023. RESULTS: A total of 352 reports were obtained during the study period, pertaining to the following SBCE systems, in descending order of frequency: Pillcam SB® system, Pillcam® Patency Capsule, Endocapsule®, CapsoCam® and MiroCam®. The vast majority pertained to the Pillcam® and Pillcam® Patency system: a total of 307 medical device reports with 398 DFs and 569 PRAEs. The most reported DFs were entrapment of the device (n=212, 53.2%), failure to transmit record (n=38, 9.5%), and failure to record (n=35, 8.7%). The most commonly reported PRAEs were a foreign body retained in the patient (n=140, 24.6%), unintentional exposure to radiation (n=104, 18.2%), and unintended exposure to anesthesia (n=58, 10.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the MAUDE database regarding SBCE devices provide valuable information on DFs and PRAEs. This knowledge can help operators optimize patient selection and reduce patient risk.",

    "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to identify adverse events involving medical devices used in home environments with a focus on patients with diabetes and to categorize the probable causes. METHODS: The chosen technologies that are fundamental for monitoring blood glucose and used in users' decision-making were: blood glucose monitor (BGM), continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and Insulin Pump. In the search for evidence, two databases from the collection of technovigilance alerts between January 2019 and December 2024 were used: the Technovigilance Analytical Portal of the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) of Brazil and MAUDE-FDA-USA. RESULTS: On the MAUDE-FDA platform, the total number of notifications were: 52,601 BGM, 1,624,664 of CGM, and 1,339,652 Insulin Pump. Strategies to mitigate the occurrence of adverse events were presented, related to human, technological, and environmental factors. Regarding the main problems reported with the patient, they were hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the need to encourage the practice of reporting to generate evidence and to present strategies to mitigate adverse events, such as developing user-centered technologies inserted in an interdisciplinary ecosystem in the form of a living laboratory; considering accessibility aspects in development and incorporation; developing guidance resources for users; considering metrological aspects to ensure technological reliability; and including sustainability, security, and data privacy actions. Interconnectivity opens up opportunities for the ubiquitous management of technological processes throughout the life cycle.",
