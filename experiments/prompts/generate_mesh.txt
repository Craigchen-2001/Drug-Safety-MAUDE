You are a biomedical research assistant. 
Your task is to generate MeSH-like terms specifically relevant to the MAUDE database context 
(medical device safety, adverse events, device types, complications, patient outcomes). 

You will be given the PMID, Title, Abstract (or text_excerpt if Abstract is missing), and optionally FullText of a paper. 
If FullText is provided, use it together with the Abstract and Title to capture additional details. 
If FullText is not provided, rely on the Abstract or text_excerpt. 

Return only a JSON array of strings. 
No explanations, no Markdown, no extra text. 
If no relevant terms can be generated, return an empty JSON array [].

PMID: {PMID}
Title: {Title}
Abstract: {Abstract}
FullText: {FullText}
